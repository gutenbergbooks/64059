<p class='c010'>THE GREAT INTEREST manifested in the life-stories
of successful men and women, which have been
published from time to time in the magazine <span class='sc'>Success</span>, has
actuated their production in book form. Many of these
sketches have been revised and rewritten, and new ones
have been added. They all contain the elements that
make men and women successful; and they are intended
to show that character, energy, and an indomitable ambition
will succeed in the world, and that in this land,
where all men are born equal and have an equal chance
in life, there is no reason for despair. I believe that the
ideal book for youth should deal with concrete examples;
for that which is taken from real life is far more effective
than that which is culled from fancy. Character-building,
its uplifting, energizing force, has been made the basic
principle of this work.</p>

<p class='c011'>To all who have aided me I express a grateful acknowledgment;
and to none more than to those whose life-stories
are here related as a lesson to young people. Among
those who have given me special assistance in securing those
life-stories are, Mr. Harry Steele Morrison, Mr. J. Herbert
Welch, Mr. Charles H. Garrett, Mr. Henry Irving Dodge,
and Mr. Jesse W. Weik. I am confident that the remarkable
exhibit of successful careers made in this book—careers
based on sound business principles and honesty—will
meet with appreciation on the part of the reading
public.</p>

<p class='c013'>MARSHALL FIELD</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>THIS world-renowned merchant is not
easily accessible to interviews, and he
seeks no fame for his business achievements.
Yet, there is no story more significant,
none more full of encouragement and inspiration
for youth.</p>

<p class='c011'>In relating it, as he told it, I have removed
my own interrogations, so far as possible, from
the interview.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was born in Conway, Massachusetts,” he
said, “in 1835. My father’s farm was among
the rocks and hills of that section, and not very
fertile. All the people were poor in those days.
My father was a man who had good judgment,
and he made a success out of the farming business.
My mother was of a more intellectual
bent. Both my parents were anxious that their
boys should amount to something in life, and
their interest and care helped me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“I had but few books, scarcely any to speak
of. There was not much time for literature.
Such books as we had, I made use of.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had a leaning toward business, and took
up with it as early as possible. I was naturally
of a saving disposition: I had to be. Those
were saving times. A dollar looked very big
to us boys in those days; and as we had difficult
labor in earning it, we did not quickly
spend it. I however,</p>
<h3 class='c015'>DETERMINED NOT TO REMAIN POOR.”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Did you attend both school and college?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I attended the common and high schools
at home, but not long. I had no college training.
Indeed, I cannot say that I had much of
any public school education. I left home when
seventeen years of age, and of course had not
time to study closely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My first venture in trade was made as
clerk in a country store at Pittsfield, Massachusetts,
where everything was sold, including dry-goods.
There I remained for four years, and
picked up my first knowledge of business. I</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SAVED MY EARNINGS AND ATTENDED STRICTLY TO BUSINESS,</h3>
<p class='c017'>and so made those four years valuable to me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Before I went West, my employer offered me
a quarter interest in his business if I would remain
with him. Even after I had been here
several years, he wrote and offered me a third
interest if I would go back.</p>
<p class='c011'>“But I was already too well placed. I was
always interested in the commercial side of life.
To this I bent my energies; and</p>
<h3 class='c015'>I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WOULD BE A MERCHANT.</h3>

<p class='c016'>“In Chicago, I entered as a clerk in the dry-goods
house of Cooley, Woodsworth &amp; Co., in
South Water street. There was no guarantee
at that time that this place would ever become
the western metropolis; the town had plenty of
ambition and pluck, but the possibilities of
greatness were hardly visible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is interesting to note in this connection
how closely the story of Mr. Field’s progress
is connected with Chicago’s marvelous growth.
The city itself in its relations to the West, was</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AN OPPORTUNITY.</h3>

<p class='c016'>A parallel, almost exact, may be drawn between
the individual career and the growth of
the town. Chicago was organized in 1837, two
years after Mr. Field was born on the far-off
farm in New England, and the place then had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>a population of a little more than four thousand.
In 1856, when Mr. Field, fully equipped
for a successful mercantile career, became a
resident of the future metropolis of the West,
the population had grown to little more than
eighty-four thousand. Mr. Field’s prosperity
advanced with the growth of the city; with
Chicago he was stricken but not crushed by the
great fire of 1871; and with Chicago he advanced
again to higher achievement and far
greater prosperity than before the calamity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What were your equipments for success
when you started as a clerk here in Chicago,
in 1856?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Health and ambition, and what I believe to
be sound principles;” answered Mr. Field.
“And here I found that in a growing town, no
one had to wait for promotion. Good business
qualities were promptly discovered, and
men were pushed forward rapidly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After four years, in 1860, I was made a
partner, and in 1865, there was a partial reorganization,
and the firm consisted after that of
Mr. Leiter, Mr. Palmer and myself (Field,
Palmer, and Leiter). Two years later Mr.
Palmer withdrew, and until 1881, the style of
the firm was Field, Leiter &amp; Co. Mr. Leiter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>retired in that year, and since then it has been
as at present (Marshall Field &amp; Co.).”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What contributed most to the great growth
of your business?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To answer that question,” said Mr. Field,
“would be to review the condition of the West
from the time Chicago began until the fire in
1871. Everything was coming this way; immigration,
railways and water traffic, and Chicago
was enjoying ‘flush’ times.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There were things to learn about the country,
and the man who learned the quickest fared
the best. For instance, the comparative newness
of rural communities and settlements made a
knowledge of local solvency impossible. The
old State banking system prevailed, and speculation
of every kind was rampant.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A CASH BASIS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“The panic of 1857 swept almost everything
away except the house I worked for, and
<i>I learned that the reason they survived was
because they understood the nature of the new
country, and did a cash business</i>. That is, they
bought for cash, and sold on thirty and sixty
days; instead of giving the customers, whose
financial condition you could hardly tell anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>about, all the time they wanted. <i>When
the panic came, they had no debts, and little
owing to them</i>, and so they weathered it all
right. <i>I learned what I consider my best lesson,
and that was to do a cash business.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What were some of the <i>principles</i> you applied
to your business?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>I made it a point that all goods should be
exactly what they were represented to be. It
was a rule of the house that an exact scrutiny
of the quality of all goods purchased should
be maintained, and that nothing was to induce
the house to place upon the market any line of
goods at a shade of variation from their real
value. Every article sold must be regarded as
warranted, and</i></p>
<h3 class='c015'>EVERY PURCHASER MUST BE ENABLED TO FEEL SECURE.”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Did you suffer any losses or reverses during
your career?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No loss except by the fire of 1871. It
swept away everything,—about three and a
half millions. We were, of course, protected
by insurance, which would have been sufficient
against any ordinary calamity of the kind. But
the disaster was so sweeping that some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>companies which had insured our property were
blotted out, and a long time passed before our
claims against others were settled. We managed,
however, to start again. There were no
buildings of brick or stone left standing, but
there were some great shells of horse-car barns
at State and Twentieth streets which were not
burned, and I hired those. We put up signs
announcing that we would continue business
uninterruptedly, and then rushed the work of
fitting things up and getting in the stock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did the panic of 1873 affect your business?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all. We did not have any debts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“May I ask, Mr. Fields, what you consider
to have been</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE TURNING POINT</h3>
<p class='c017'>in your career,—the point after which there
was no more danger?”</p>
<p class='c011'>“Saving the first five thousand dollars I ever
had, when I might just as well have spent
the moderate salary I made. Possession of that
sum, once I had it, gave me <i>the ability to meet
opportunities</i>. That I consider the turning-point.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What trait of character do you look upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>as having been the most essential in your
career?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Perseverance</i>,” said Mr. Field. But Mr.
Selfridge, his most trusted lieutenant, in whose
private office we were, insisted upon the addition
of “<i>good judgment</i>” to this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I am compelled to lay claim to such
traits,” added Mr. Fields, “it is because I have
tried to practise them, and the trying has availed
me much. I have tried to make all my acts
and commercial moves the result of definite
consideration and sound judgment. <i>There were
never any great ventures or risks.</i> I practised
honest, slow-growing business methods, and
tried to back them with energy and good
system.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this point, in answer to further questions,
Mr. Field disclaimed having overworked in his
business, although after the fire of ’71 he
worked about eighteen hours a day for several
weeks:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“My fortune, however, has not been made
in that manner. I believe in reasonable hours,
but close attention during those hours. I never
worked very many hours a day. People do not
work as many hours now as they once did.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The day’s labor has shortened in the last
twenty years for everyone.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>QUALITIES THAT MAKE FOR SUCCESS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What, Mr. Field,” I said, “do you consider
to be the first requisite for success in life,
so far as the young beginner is concerned?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The qualities of <i>honesty</i>, <i>energy</i>, <i>frugality</i>,
<i>integrity</i>, are more necessary than ever to-day,
and there is no success without them. They are
so often urged that they have become commonplace,
but they are really more prized than
ever. And any good fortune that comes by
such methods is deserved and admirable.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND BUSINESS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Do you believe a college education for the
young man to be a necessity in the future?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not for business purposes. Better training
will become more and more a necessity. The
truth is, with most young men, a college education
means that just at the time when they
should be having business principles instilled
into them, and be getting themselves energetically
pulled together for their life’s work, they
are sent to college. Then intervenes what many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>a young man looks back on as the jolliest time
of his life,—four years of college. Often
when he comes out of college the young man is
unfitted by this good time to buckle down to hard
work, and the result is a failure to grasp opportunities
that would have opened the way for
a successful career.”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>As to retiring from business</i>, Mr. Field remarked:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not believe that, when a man no longer
attends to his private business in person every
day, he has given up interest in affairs. He
may be, in fact should be, doing wider and
greater work. There certainly is no pleasure
in idleness. A man, upon giving up business,
does not cease laboring, but really does or
should do more in a larger sense. He should
interest himself in public affairs. There is no
happiness in mere dollars. After they are acquired,
one can use but a moderate amount. It
is given a man to eat so much, to wear so much,
and to have so much shelter, and more he cannot
use. When money has supplied these, its
mission, so far as the individual is concerned,
is fulfilled, and man must look further and
higher. It is only in the wider public affairs,
where money is a moving force toward the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>general welfare, that the possessor of it can
possibly find pleasure, and that only in constantly
doing more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What,” I said, “in your estimation, is the
greatest good a man can do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The greatest good he can do is to cultivate
himself, develop his powers, in order that he
may be of greater use to humanity.”</p>

    <div>HINTS ON SUCCESS BY ALEXANDER G. BELL.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c018'>EXTREMELY polite, always anxious to
render courtesy, no one carries great
success more gracefully than Alexander
G. Bell, the inventor of the telephone.
His graciousness has won many a friend, the
admiration of many more, and has smoothed

<h3 class='c015'>A NIGHT WORKER</h3>

<p class='c016'>When I first went to see him, it was about
eleven o’clock in the morning, and he was in
bed! The second time, I thought I would go
somewhat later,—at one o’clock in the afternoon.
He was eating his breakfast, I was told;
and I had to wait some time. He came in
apologizing profusely for keeping me waiting.
When I told him I had come to interview him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>in behalf of young people, about success—its
underlying principles,—he threw back his large
head and laughingly said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Nothing succeeds like success.’ Success
did you say? Why, that is a big subject,—too
big a one. You must give me time to think
about it; and you having planted the seed in my
brain, will have to wait for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When I asked what time I should call, he
said: “Come any time, if it is only late. I
begin my work at about nine or ten o’clock in
the evening, and continue until four or five in
the morning. Night is a more quiet time to
work. It aids thought.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So, when I went to see him again, I made it
a point to be late. He cordially invited me into
his studio, where, as we both sat on a large
and comfortable sofa, he talked long on</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE SUBJECT OF SUCCESS.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The value of this article would be greatly
enhanced, if I could add his charming manner
of emphasizing what he says, with hands, head,
and eyes; and if I could add his beautiful distinctness
of speech, due, a great deal, to his
having given instruction to deaf-mutes, who
must read the lips.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“What do you think are the factors of success?”
I asked. The reply was prompt and to
the point.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>PERSEVERANCE APPLIED TO A PRACTICAL END</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Perseverance is the chief; but perseverance
must have some practical end, or it does
not avail the man possessing it. A person
without a practical end in view becomes a
crank or an idiot. Such persons fill our insane
asylums. The same perseverance that they
show in some idiotic idea, if exercised in the
accomplishment of something practicable, would
no doubt bring success. Perseverance is first,
but practicability is chief. The success of the
Americans as a nation is due to their great
practicability.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But often what the world calls nonsensical,
becomes practical, does it not? You were
called crazy, too, once, were you not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are some things, though, that are
always impracticable. Now, take, for instance,
this idea of perpetual motion. Scientists have
proved that it is impossible. Yet our patent
office is continually beset by people applying for
inventions on some perpetual motion machine.
So the department has adopted a rule whereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>a working model is always required of such
applicants. They cannot furnish one. The impossible
is incapable of success.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have heard of people dreaming inventions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is not at all impossible. I am a believer
in unconscious cerebration. The brain
is working all the time, though we do not know
it. At night, it follows up what we think in
the daytime. When I have worked a long time
on one thing, I make it a point to bring all the
facts regarding it together before I retire; and
I have often been surprised at the results. Have
you not noticed that, often, what was dark and
perplexing to you the night before, is found to
be perfectly solved the next morning? We are
thinking all the time; it is impossible not to
think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can everyone become an inventor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no; not all minds are constituted alike.
Some minds are only adapted to certain things.
But as one’s mind grows, and one’s knowledge
of the world’s industries widens, it adapts itself
to such things as naturally fall to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon my asking the relation of health to success,
the professor replied:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe it to be a primary principle of success;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>‘mens sana in corpore sano,’—a sound
mind in a sound body. The mind in a weak
body produces weak ideas; a strong body gives
strength to the thought of the mind. Ill health
is due to man’s artificiality of living. He lives
indoors. He becomes, as it were, a hothouse
plant. Such a plant is never as successful as a
hardy garden plant is. An outdoor life is necessary
to health and success, especially in a
youth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But is not hard study often necessary to
success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; decidedly not. You cannot force ideas.
Successful ideas are the result of slow growth.
Ideas do not reach perfection in a day, no
matter how much study is put upon them. It is
<i>perseverance</i> in the pursuit of studies that is
really wanted.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>CONCENTRATION OF PURPOSE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Next must come concentration of purpose
and study. That is another thing I mean to
emphasize. Concentrate all your thought upon
the work in hand. The sun’s rays do not burn
until brought to a focus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am now thinking about flying machines.
Everything in regard to them, I pick out and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>read. When I see a bird flying in the air, I
note its manner of flight, as I would not if I
were not constantly thinking about artificial
flight, and concentrating all my thought and
observation upon it. It is like a man who has
made the acquaintance of some new word that
has been brought forcibly to his notice, although
he may have come across it many times before,
and not have noticed it particularly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Man is the result of slow growth</i>; that is
why he occupies the position he does in animal
life. What does a pup amount to that has
gained its growth in a few days or weeks, beside
a man who only attains it in as many years. A
horse is often a grandfather before a boy has
attained his full maturity. The most successful
men in the end are those whose success is the
result of steady accretion. That intellectuality
is more vigorous that has attained its strength
gradually. It is the man who carefully advances
step by step, with his mind becoming
wider and wider,—and progressively better
able to grasp any theme or situation,—persevering
in what he knows to be practical, and
concentrating his thought upon it, who is bound
to succeed in the greatest degree.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>YOUNG AMERICAN GEESE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“If a man is not bound down, he is sure to
succeed. He may be bound down by environment,
or by doting parental petting. In Paris,
they fatten geese to create a diseased condition
of the liver. A man stands with a box of very
finely prepared and very rich food beside a revolving
stand, and, as it revolves, one goose
after another passes before him. Taking the
first goose by the neck, he clamps down its
throat a large lump of the food, whether the
goose will or no, until its crop is well stuffed
out, and then he proceeds with the rest in the
same very mechanical manner. Now, I think,
if those geese had to work hard for their own
food, they would digest it better, and be far
healthier geese. How many young American
geese are stuffed in about the same manner at
college and at home, by their rich and fond
parents!”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>UNHELPFUL READING</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Did everything you ever studied help you
to attain success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the contrary, I did not begin real study
until I was over sixteen. Until that time, my
principal study was—reading novels.” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>laughed heartily at my evident astonishment.
“They did not help me in the least, for they
did not give me an insight into real life. It
is only those things that give one a grasp of
practical affairs that are helpful. To read
novels continuously is like reading fairy stories
or “Arabian Nights” tales. It is a butterfly
existence, so long as it lasts; but, some day, one
is called to stern reality, unprepared.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>INVENTIONS IN AMERICA</h3>

<p class='c016'>“You have had experience in life in Europe
and in America. Do you think the chances for
success are the same in Europe as in
America?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is harder to attain success in Europe.
There is hardly the same appreciation of progress
there is here. Appreciation is an element
of success. Encouragement is needed. My
thoughts run mostly toward inventions. In
England, people are conservative. They are
well contented with the old, and do not readily
adopt new ideas. Americans more quickly appreciate
new inventions. Take an invention to
an Englishman or a Scot, and he will ask you
all about it, and then say your invention may
be all right, but let somebody else try it first.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Take the same invention to an American, and
if it is intelligently explained, he is generally
quick to see the feasibility of it. America is
an inspiration to inventors. It is quicker to
adopt advanced ideas than England or Europe.
The most valuable inventions of this century
have been made in America.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE ORIENT</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Do you think there is a chance for Americans
in the Orient?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is only a chance for capital in trade.
American labor cannot compete with Japanese
and Chinese. A Japanese coolie, for the
hardest kind of work, receives the equivalent of
six cents a day; and the whole family, father,
mother and children, work and contribute to
the common good. A foreigner is only made
use of until they have absorbed all his useful
ideas; then he is avoided. The Japanese are
ahead of us in many things.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>ENVIRONMENT AND HEREDITY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Do you think environment and heredity
count in success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Environment, certainly; heredity, not so
distinctly. In heredity, a man may stamp out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the faults he has inherited. There is no chance
for the proper working of heredity. If selection
could be carried out, a man might owe
much to heredity. But as it is, only opposites
marry. Blonde and light-complexioned people
marry brunettes, and the tall marry the short.
In our scientific societies, men only are admitted.
If women who were interested especially
in any science were allowed to affiliate
with the men in these societies, we might hope
to see some wonderful workings of the laws of
heredity. A man, as a general rule, owes very
little to what he is born with. A man is what
he makes of himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Environment counts for a great deal. A
man’s particular idea may have no chance for
growth or encouragement in his community.
Real success is denied that man, until he finds
a proper environment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>America is a good environment for young
men. It breathes the very spirit of success. I
noticed at once, when I first came to this
country, how the people were all striving for
success, and helping others to attain success. It
is an inspiration you cannot help feeling.</i>
<span class='sc'>America is the land of success.</span>”</p>

  <h3 class='c015'>PROFESSOR BELL’S LIFE STORY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh,
Scotland, March 3, 1847. His father,
Alexander Melville Bell, now in Washington,
D.C., was a distinguished Scottish educator,
and the inventor of a system of “visible
speech,” which he has successfully taught to
deaf-mutes. His grandfather, Alexander Bell,
became well known by the invention of a
method of removing impediments of speech.</p>

<p class='c011'>The younger Bell received his education at
the Edinburgh High School and University;
and, in 1867, he entered the University of London.
Then, in his twenty-third year, his health
failing from over-study, he came with his father
to Canada, as he expressed it, “to die.” Later,
he settled in the United States, becoming first a
teacher of deaf-mutes, and subsequently professor
of vocal physiology in Boston University.
In 1867, he first began to study the problem of
conveying articulate sound by electric currents;
which he pursued during his leisure time.
After nine long years of research and experiment,
he completed the first telephone, early in
1876, when it was exhibited at the Centennial
Exposition, and pronounced the “wonder of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>wonders in electric telegraphy.” This was the
judgment of scientific men who were in a position
to judge, and not of the world at large.
People regarded it only as a novelty, as a curious
scientific toy; and most business men
doubted that it would ever prove a useful factor
in the daily life of the world, and the untold
blessing to mankind it has since become. All
this skepticism he had to overcome. “A new
art was to be taught to the world, a new industry
created, business and social methods
revolutionized.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“I WILL MAKE THE WORLD HEAR IT”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“It does speak,” cried Sir William Thompson,
with fervid enthusiasm; and Bell’s father-in-law
added: “I will make the world hear it.”
In less than a quarter of a century, it is conveying
thought in every civilized tongue; Japan
being the first country outside of the United
States to adopt it. In the first eight years of
its existence, the Bell Telephone Company declared
dividends to the extent of $4,000,000;
and the great sums of money the company earns
for its stockholders is a subject of current comment
and wonder. Some fierce contests have
been waged over the priority of his invention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>but Mr. Bell has been triumphant in every
case.</p>

<p class='c011'>He has become very wealthy from his invention.
He has a beautiful winter residence in
Washington; fitted up with a laboratory, and
all sorts of electrical conveniences mostly of his
own invention. His summer residence is at
Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c011'>His wife, Mabel, the daughter of the late
Gardiner G. Hubbard, is a deaf-mute, of whose
education he had charge when she was a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bell, with one of his beautiful daughters,
recently made a visit to Japan. The Order of
the Rising Star, the highest order in the gift
of the Japanese Emperor, was bestowed upon
him. He is greatly impressed by the character
of the people; believing them capable of much
greater advancement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bell is the inventor of the photophone,
aiming to transmit speech by a vibratory beam
of light. He has given much time and study
to problems of multiplex telegraphy, and to
efforts to record speech by photographing the
vibrations of a jet of water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Few inventors have derived as much satisfaction
and happiness from their achievements
as Mr. Bell. In this respect, his success has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>been ideal, and in impressive contrast with the
experience of Charles Goodyear, the man who
made india-rubber useful, and of some other
well-known inventors, whose services to mankind
brought no substantial reward to themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Bell is in nowise spoiled by his good fortune;
but is the same unpretending person to-day,
that he was before the telephone made him
wealthy and famous.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>III</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>Why the American People Like Helen Gould</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>MISS HELEN GOULD has won a
place for herself in the hearts of
Americans such as few people of
great wealth ever gain. Her strong character,
commonsense, and high ideals, have made her
respected by all, while her munificence and
kindness have won for her the love of many.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon my arrival at her Tarrytown home, I
was made to feel that I was welcome, and everyone
who enters her presence feels the same.
The grand mansion, standing high on the hills
overlooking the Hudson, has a home-like appearance.
Chickens play around the little stone
cottage at the grand entrance, and the grounds
are not unlike those of any other country house,
with trees in abundance, and beautiful lawns.
There are large beds of flowers, and in the
gardens all the summer vegetables were growing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Miss Gould takes a very great interest in her
famous greenhouses, the gardens, the flowers,
and the chickens, for she is a home-loving
woman. It is a common thing to see her in the
grounds, digging and raking and planting, like
some farmer’s girl. That is one reason why her
neighbors all like her; she seems so unconscious
of her wealth and station.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A FACE FULL OF CHARACTER</h3>

<p class='c016'>When I entered Lyndhurst, she came forward
to meet me in the pleasantest way imaginable.
Her face is not exactly beautiful, but has
a great deal of character written upon it, and it
is very attractive. She held out her hand for
me to shake in the good old-fashioned way, and
then we sat down in the wide hall to talk. Miss
Gould was dressed very simply. Her gown
was of dark cloth, close-fitting, and her skirt
hung several inches above the ground, for she is
a believer in short skirts for walking. Her entire
costume was very becoming. She never
over-dresses, and her garments are neat, and
naturally of excellent quality.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HER AMBITIONS AND AIMS</h3>

<p class='c016'>In the conversation that followed, I was permitted
to learn much of her ambitions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>aims. She is ambitious to leave an impression
on the world by good deeds well done, and this
ambition is gratified to the utmost. She is
modest about her work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot find that I am doing much at all,”
she said, “when there is so very much to be
done. I suppose I shouldn’t expect to be able
to do everything, but I sometimes feel that I
want to, nevertheless.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A MOST CHARMING CHARITY</h3>

<p class='c016'>One of her most charming charities is
“Woody Crest,” two miles from Lyndhurst,
a haven of delight where some twoscore waifs
are received at a time for a two weeks’ visit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Years before Miss Gould’s name became associated
throughout the country with charity,
she was doing her part in trying to make a
world happier. Every summer she was hostess
to scores of poor children, who were guests at
one of the two Gould summer homes; little
people with pinched, wan faces, and crippled
children from the tenements, were taken to that
home and entertained. They came in relays, a
new company arriving once in two weeks, the
number of children thus given a taste of heaven
on earth being limited only by the capacity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the Gould residence. This was her first, and, I
am told, her favorite charity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little children do things naturally. It was
when a child that Helen Gould commenced the
work that has given her name a sacred significance.
When a little girl, she could see the less
fortunate little girls passing the great Gould
home on Fifth avenue, and she pitied them and
loved them, and from her own allowance administered
to their comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father always encouraged me in charitable
work,” she writes a friend. How much
the American people owe to that encouragement.
A frown from that father, idolized as
he was by his daughter, would have frosted and
killed that budding philanthropy which has made
a great fortune a fountain of joy, and carried
sunshine into many lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Woody Crest” is a sylvan paradise, a nobly
wooded hill towering above the sumptuous
green of Westchester, a place with wild flowers
and winding drives, and at its crest a solid
mansion built of the native rock. One can look
out from its luxuriant lawns to the majestic
Hudson, or turn aside into the shadiest of nooks
among the trees. What a place for the restful
breezes to fan the tired brows from the tenements.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Do the little folks enjoy it? Ask them,
and their eyes will sparkle with gladness for
answer. Ask those, too, who are awaiting their
turn in hot New York, and watch the eagerness
of their anticipation. For two long and happy
weeks they become as joyous as mortals are ever
permitted to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Gould has a personal oversight of the
place, and, by her frequent visits, makes friends
with the wee visitors, who look upon her as a
combination of angel and fairy godmother.
Every day, a wagonette drawn by two horses
takes the children, in relays, for long drives into
the country. Amusements are provided, and
some of those who remain for an entire season
at Woody Crest are instructed in different
branches. Twice a month some of the older
boys set the type for a little magazine which is
devoted to Woody Crest matters. There are
several portable cottages erected there, one for
the sick, one for servants’ sleeping rooms, and
a third for a laundry.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the munificent hostess of these children
of the needy gets her reward in eyes made
bright, in cheeks made ruddy, in the “God
bless you,” that falls from the lips of grateful
parents.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>All winter long, instead of closing “Woody
Crest” and waiting for the summer sunshine
to bring about a return of her charitable opportunities,
Miss Gould has kept the place running
at full expense. During the winter she
herself occupies her town residence. Ordinarily
she would not keep “Woody Crest”
open longer than Thanksgiving Day, but in the
past winter fifteen small boys were entertained
for six months. Six of these were cripples, and
nine were sound of limb. Though it required
many servants, I am told that the little guests
were given as much consideration as the same
number of grown people would have received.
They had nurses and physicians for those who
needed them, governesses and instructors for
those who were well.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HER PRACTICAL SYMPATHY FOR THE LESS FAVORED</h3>

<p class='c016'>When, one day, I was privileged to meet Miss
Gould at Woody Crest, I saw a hundred children
scattered around the lawn in front of the
stately mansion. It had been an afternoon of
labor and anxiety on her part, for she felt the
responsibility of entertaining and caring for so
many little ones. As she finally cooled herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>on the piazza and looked at her little charges
romping around on the lawn, I asked her if she
thought any of the little ones before her would
ever make their mark in the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s hard to say,” she replied, after a
moment’s hesitation, “but no one can tell what
may be in children until they have grown up
and developed. But the hardest thing to me
is to see genius struggling under obstacles and
in surroundings that would discourage almost
anybody. I do not see, for my part, how any
child from the poorest tenements could ever
grow up and develop into strong, successful
men or women. Many of them, of course, have
no gifts or endowments to do this, but even if
they had, the surroundings are enough to stifle
every spark of ambition in them. It is a
mystery to me how they can preserve such
bright and eager faces. What would we do
if we were brought up in such environments!
I know I should never be able to survive it, and
would never succeed in rising above my surroundings.
And it is harder on the girls than
the boys! The boys can go forth into the world
and probably secure a position which in time
will bring them different companionship and
surroundings; but the poor girls have so few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>opportunities. They must drudge and drag
along for the bare necessities of life. My heart
aches sometimes for them, and I wish I had the
power to lighten the burdens of everyone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The hardest thing, I suppose, is to see real
ability fighting against odds, with no one to
help and encourage?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that seems the worst, and I think we
all ought to make it possible for such ones to
get a little encouragement and help. When a
boy is deserving of credit it should be given
unstintedly. It goes a long way toward making
him more hopeful for the future. We don’t
as a rule receive enough encouragement in this
world. Certainly not the poor. Everybody
seems so busy and intent upon making his own
way in the world that he forgets to drop a word
of cheer for those who have not been so fortunate
by birth or surroundings.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f1'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—For four paragraphs preceding I am indebted
to <span class='sc'>George Ethelbert Walsh</span>, whose interview
was published in the <i>Boston Transcript</i>, Oct. 12, 1900.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For a number of years, Miss Gould has supported
certain beds in the Babies’ Shelter, in
connection with the Church of the Holy Communion,
New York, and the Wayside Day
Nursery, near Bellevue Hospital, has always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>found in her a good friend. Once a year she
makes a tour through the day nurseries of New
York, noting the special needs of each, and
often sending money or materials for meeting
those needs.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>PERSONAL ATTENTION TO AN UNSELFISH SERVICE</h3>

<p class='c016'>Her charities, says Mr. Walsh, in the article
above cited, are probably the most practical on
record. She does not go “slumming,” as so
many fashionable girls do, but she does go and
investigate personal charities herself and apply
the medicine as she thinks best. She puts herself
out in more ways to relieve distress around
than she would to accommodate her wealthiest
friend. Not only has she always pitied the sufferers
in the world less fortunate than herself,
but she has always had a great desire to help
those struggling for a living in practical ways
to get along. It is this side of her noble work
that stands out most conspicuously to-day. The
public realizes for the first time that this young
woman, who first came into actual fame at the
time of our war with Spain, has been supporting
and encouraging young people in different
parts of the country for years past. These protéges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>are all worthy of her patronage, and <i>they
have been sought out by her. Not one has ever
approached Miss Gould for help, and in fact
such an introduction would undoubtedly operate
against her inclination to help them</i>. <i>She has
discovered them</i>; and then through considerable
tact and discretion obtained from them their
ambitious desires and hopes. Through equally
good tact and sense she has then placed them in
positions where they could work out their own
destinies without feeling that they were accepting
charity. This is distinctly what Miss Gould
wishes to avoid in helping her little protéges.
She does not offer them charity or do anything
to make them dependent upon her if it can be
helped. By her money and influence she obtains
for them positions which will give them
every chance in the world to rise and develop
talents which she thinks she has discovered in
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of her protéges, continues Mr. Walsh,
have been sent away to schools and colleges.
One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is to
offer a scholarship in some institution and then
place her young protége in such a position that
he or she can win it, and in this way have four
years of tuition free. Fully a dozen different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>scholars are now enjoying the benefits of Miss
Gould’s kindness in this and other respects.
Four others have been enabled to attend art
schools, and two are studying music under the
best teachers through the instrumentality of
this young woman. Two of these scholars were
literally rescued from the tenement dregs of
New York, and they showed such aptitude for
study and work that Miss Gould undertook to
give them a fair start in the world. Unusual
aptitude, brightness, or kindness on the part of
children always attract Miss Gould, and she has
become the patron saint of more than a hundred.
When her name is mentioned they show
their interest and concern, not by looks of awe
and fear but of eagerness and happiness. Those
of their number who have been lifted from their
low estate and put in high positions to carve out
a life of success through their common patron
saint, bring back stories of her kindness and
consideration that make the children look upon
her as they would the Madonna. But she is a
youthful Madonna, and the very idea of posing
as such, even before the poor and ignorant of
her little friends, would amuse her. Nevertheless,
that is the nearest that one can interpret
their ideas concerning her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Miss Gould’s beneficiaries have been sometimes
aided in obtaining the most advanced
schooling in the land; and she visits with equal
interest the industrial classes of Berea and the
favored students of the College Beautiful.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HER VIEWS UPON EDUCATION</h3>

<p class='c016'>Miss Gould is well educated, and a graduate
of a law school. I tried to ascertain her views
regarding the education of young women of to-day,
and what careers they should follow. This
is one of her particular hobbies, and many are
the young girls she has helped to attain to a
better and more satisfactory life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe most earnestly in education for
women,” she said; “not necessarily the higher
education about which we hear so much, but a
good, common-school education. As the years
pass, girls are obliged to make their own way in
the world more and more; and to do so, they
must have good schooling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what particular career do you think
most desirable for young women?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, as to careers, there are many that
young women follow, nowadays. I think, if I
had my own way to make, I should fit myself
to be a private secretary. That is a position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>which attracts nearly every young woman; but,
to fill it, she must study hard and learn, and
then work hard to keep the place. Then there
are openings for young women in the fields of
legitimate business. Women know as much
about money affairs as men, only most of them
have not had much experience. In that field,
there are hundreds of things that a woman can
do.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE EVIL OF IDLENESS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“But I don’t think it matters much what a
girl does so long as she is active, and doesn’t
allow herself to stagnate. There’s nothing, to
my mind, so pathetic as a girl who thinks she
can’t do anything, and is of no use to the
world.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HER PATRIOTISM</h3>

<p class='c016'>The late Admiral Philip, he of the “Texas”
in the Santiago fight, regarded Miss Gould as an
angel, and the sailors of the Brooklyn navy yard
fairly worship her. A hustling Y. M. C. A.
chap, Frank Smith by name, started a little
club-house for “Jack Ashore,” near the Brooklyn
navy yard. Miss Gould heard of this club,
and visited it. At a glance she grasped the
meaning, and, on her return home she wrote a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>letter and a check for fifty thousand dollars, and
there sprang from that letter and check, a handsome
building in which there are sixty beds, a
library, a pipe organ, a smoking-room, and a
restaurant. Do you wonder that the “Jackies”
adore her, and that the gale that sweeps over
the ship out in the open sea is often freighted
with the melody of her name?</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I visited Cuba and Porto Rico,” says
Congressman Charles B. Landis, of Indiana,—to
whom I am greatly indebted in preparing
this article,—“I talked with officers and privates
everywhere along the journey, visited
camps and hospitals in cities and isolated towns,
and everywhere it seemed that the sickness and
suffering and heart yearning of the American
soldier had been anticipated by Helen Gould.
Voices that quivered and eyes that moistened at
the mention of the name of this young American
girl were one continuous tribute to her heart
and work. She cannot fully realize how far-reaching
have been her efforts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A business man looks for results. What impressed
me most with Miss Gould’s work was
the visible, tangible results. Every dollar spent
by her seemed to go, straight as a cannon-ball,
to some mark. Miss Gould has a business head,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and is not hysterical in her work. She gives,
but follows the gift and sees that it goes to the
spot. She has studied results and knows which
charity pays a premium in smiles, and tears,
and joy, and better life, and very little of her
money will be wasted in impracticable schemes.
She has a happy faculty of getting in actual
touch with conditions, realizing that she cannot
hit an object near at hand by aiming at a star.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Gould’s practical business sense was
beautifully exemplified at Montauk Point.
Hundreds of soldiers from the hospitals in Cuba
and Porto Rico were suddenly unloaded there.
Elsewhere were government supplies—tents
and cots and rations,—but there the sick
soldiers were without shelter, were hungry, had
no medicine, and were sleeping on the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Why? Because of red tape. This young
lady appeared in person and amazed the strutters
in shoulder-straps and the slaves to discipline
by having the sick soldier boys made comfortable
on army cots, placed in army tents, and
fed on army rations,—and this, too, without
any “requisition.” She grasped a situation,
cut the ropes of theory and introduced practice.
From her own purse she provided nurses and
dainties, and bundled up scores of soldier boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and sent them to her beautiful villa on the Hudson.</p>

<p class='c011'>The camp rang with this refrain:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You’re the angel of the camp,</div>

      <div class='line'>At the rustle of your wings,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Helen Gould.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c015'>“OUR HELEN”</h3>

<p class='c016'>On the day of the Dewey parade in New
York, Miss Gould was in front of her house, on
a platform she had erected for the small children
of certain Asylums. Mayor Van Wyck
told Admiral Dewey who she was, and the Admiral
stood up in his carriage and bowed to her
three times. Then the word went down the
line that Miss Gould was there, and every company
saluted her as it passed.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was when a body of young recruits
stopped for a moment before her door that the
real excitement began.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“She shan’t marry a foreign prince,” they
cried, tossing their hats and stamping their feet.
“She’s Helen, our Helen, and she shall not
marry a foreign prince.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“AMERICA”</h3>

<p class='c016'>Miss Gould’s patriotism is very real and intense,
and is not confined to times of war. Two
years ago, she caused fifty thousand copies of
the national hymn, “America,” to be printed
and distributed among the pupils of the public
schools of New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe every one should know that hymn
and sing it,” she declared, “if he sings no
other. I would like to have the children sing
it into their very souls, till it becomes a part of
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She strongly favors patriotic services in the
churches on the Sunday preceding the Fourth
of July, when she would like to hear such airs
as “America,” “Hail Columbia,” and “The
Star Spangled Banner,” and see the sacred edifices

<h3 class='c015'>UNHERALDED BENEFACTIONS</h3>

<p class='c016'>Miss Gould has a strong prejudice against
letting her many gifts and charities be known,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and even her dearest friends never know “what
Helen’s doing now.” Of course, her great
public charities, as when she gives a hundred
thousand dollars at a time, are heralded. Her
recent gift of that sum to the government, for
national defense, has made her name beloved
throughout the land; but, had she been able, she
would have kept that secret also.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place Helen Gould now holds in the love
and esteem of the republic exemplifies how
quickly the nation’s heart responds to the touch
of gentleness, and how easy it is for wealth to
conquer and rise triumphant, if only it be seasoned
with common sense and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>I will not attempt to specify the numerous
projects of charity that have been given life and
vigor by Miss Gould. I know her gifts in recent
years have passed the million-dollar mark.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems so easy to do things for others,”
said Miss Gould, recently. It is easy to do
good, if the doing is natural and without
thought of self-glorification.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Gould’s views upon “How to Make the
Most of Wealth,” are well set forth in her admirable
letter to Dr. Louis Klopsch, as published
in the <i>Christian Herald</i>:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Christian idea that wealth is a stewardship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>or trust, and not to be used for one’s personal
pleasure alone, but for the welfare of
others, certainly seems the noblest; and those
who have more money or broader culture owe a
debt to those who have had fewer opportunities.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And there are so many ways one can help.
Children, the sick and the aged especially, have
claims on our attention, and the forms of
work for them are numerous; from kindergartens,
day-nurseries and industrial schools, to
‘homes’ and hospitals. Our institutions for
higher education require gifts in order to do
their best work, for the tuition fees do not cover
the expense of the advantages offered; and certainly
such societies as those in our churches,
and the Young Woman’s Christian Association
and the Young Men’s Christian Association,
deserve our hearty cooperation. The earnest
workers who so nobly and lovingly give their
lives to promote the welfare of others, give far
more than though they had simply made gifts of
money, so those who cannot afford to give
largely need not feel discouraged on that account.
After all, sympathy and good-will may
be a greater force than wealth, and we can all
extend to others a kindly feeling and courteous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>consideration, that will make life sweeter and
better.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sometimes it seems to me we do not sufficiently
realize the good that is done by money
that is used in the different industries in giving
employment to great numbers of people under
the direction of clever men and women; and
surely it takes more ability, perseverance and
time to successfully manage such an enterprise
than to merely make gifts.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HER PERSONALITY</h3>

<p class='c016'>Miss Gould’s life at Tarrytown is an ideal
one. She runs down to the city at frequent intervals,
to attend to business affairs; but she
lives at Lyndhurst. She entertains but few
visitors, and in turn visits but seldom. The
management of her property, to which she gives
close attention, makes no inconsiderable call
upon her time. “I have no time for society,”
she said, “and indeed I do not care for it at
all; it is very well for those who like it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Would you have an idea of her personality?
“If so,” replies Landis, “you will think of a
good young woman in your own town, who
loves her parents and her home; who is devoted
to the church; who thinks of the poor on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Thanksgiving Day and Christmas; whose face
is bright and manner unaffected; whose dress
is elegant in its simplicity; who takes an interest
in all things, from politics to religion;
whom children love and day-laborers greet by
reverently lifting the hat; and who, if she were
graduated from a home seminary or college,
would receive a bouquet from every boy in
town. If you can think of such a young woman,
and nearly every community has one
(and ninety-nine times out of a hundred she is
poor), you have a fair idea of the impression
made on a plain man from a country town by
Miss Gould.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Helen Miller Gould is just at the threshold
of her beautiful career. What a promise is
there in her life and work for the coming century?</p>

<p class='c011'>She has pledged a Hall of Fame for the campus
of the New York University, overlooking
the Harlem river. It will have tablets for the
names of fifty distinguished Americans; and
proud will be the descendants of those whose
names are inscribed thereon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The human heart is the tablet upon which
Miss Gould has inscribed her name, and her
“Hall of Fame” is as broad and high as the
republic itself.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>Philip D. Armour’s Business Career</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>I&nbsp;MET Mr. Armour in the quiet of the Armour
Institute, his great philanthropic
school for young men and women. He
was very courteous, and there was no delay.
He took my hand with a firm grasp—reading
with his steady gaze such of my characteristics
as interested him,—and saying, at the same
time, “Well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In stating my desire to learn such lessons
from his business career as might be helpful to
young men, I inquired whether the average
American boy of to-day has equally <i>as good a
chance to succeed in the world</i> as he had, when
he began life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Every bit and better. The affairs of life are
larger. There are greater things to do. There
was never before such a demand for able men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were the conditions surrounding your
youth especially difficult?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“No. They were those common to every
small New York town in 1832. I was born at
Stockbridge, in Madison county. Our family
had its roots in Scotland. My father’s ancestors
were the Robertsons, Watsons, and McGregors
of Scotland; my mother came of the
Puritans, who settled in Connecticut.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dr. Gunsaulus says,” I ventured, “that <i>all
these streams of heredity set toward business
affairs</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps so. I like trading well. My father
was reasonably prosperous and independent for
those times. My mother had been a schoolteacher.
There were six boys, and of course
such a household had to be managed with the
strictest economy in those days. My mother
thought it her duty to bring to our home some
of the rigid discipline of the school-room. We
were all trained to work together, and everything
was done as systematically as possible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had you access to any books?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the Bible, ‘Pilgrim’s Progress,’ and a
History of the United States.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said of the latter, by those closest to Mr.
Armour, that it was as full of shouting Americanism
as anything ever written, and that Mr.
Armour’s whole nature is yet colored by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>stout American prejudices; also that it was read
and re-read by the Armour children, though of
this the great merchant did not speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were you always of <i>a robust constitution</i>?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir. All our boys were. We were
stout enough to be bathed in an ice-cold spring,
out of doors, when at home. There were no
bath tubs and warm water arrangements in
those days. We had to be strong. My father
was a stern Scotchman, and when he laid his
plans they were carried out. When he set us
boys to work, we worked. It was our mother
who insisted on keeping us all at school, and
who looked after our educational needs; while
our father saw to it that we had plenty of good,
hard work on the farm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you enjoy that sort of life?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well enough, but not much more than any
boy does. Boys are always more or less afraid
of hard work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The truth is, I have heard, but not from Mr.
Armour, that when he attended the district
school, he was as full of pranks and capers as
the best; and that he traded jack-knives in
summer and bob-sleds in winter. Young Armour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>was often to be found, in the winter,
coasting down the long hill near the schoolhouse.
Later, he had a brief term of schooling
at the Cazenovia Seminary.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>FOOTING IT TO CALIFORNIA</h3>

<p class='c016'>“When did you leave the farm for a mercantile
life?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was a clerk in a store in Stockbridge for
two years, after I was seventeen, but was engaged
with the farm more or less, and wanted
to get out of that life. I was a little over seventeen
years old when the California gold excitement
of 1849 reached our town. Wonderful
tales were told of gold already found, and the
prospects for more on the Pacific coast. I
brooded over the difference between tossing hay
in the hot sun and digging up gold by handfuls,
until one day I threw down my pitchfork and
went over to the house and told mother that
I had quit that kind of work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“People with plenty of money could sail
around Cape Horn in those days, but I had no
money to spare, and so decided to walk across
the country. That is, we were carried part of
the way by rail and walked the rest. I persuaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>one of the neighbor’s boys, Calvin Gilbert,
to go along with me, and we started.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I provided myself with an old carpet sack
into which to put my clothes. I bought a new
pair of boots, and when we had gone as far as
we could on canals and wagons, I bought two
oxen. With these we managed for awhile, but
eventually reached California afoot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Young Armour suffered a severe illness on
the journey, and was nursed by his companion
Gilbert, who gathered herbs and steeped them
for his friend’s use, and once rode thirty miles
in the rain to get a doctor. When they reached
California, he fell in with Edward Croarkin, a
miner, who nursed him back to health. The
manner in which he remembered these men
gives keen satisfaction to the friends of the
great merchant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you have any money when you arrived
at the gold-fields?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Scarcely any. I struck right out, though,
and found a place where I could dig, and I
struck pay dirt in a little time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you work entirely alone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. It was not long before I met Mr.
Croarkin at a little mining camp called Virginia.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>He had the next claim to mine, and we became
partners. After a little while, he went away,
but came back in a year. We then bought in
together. The way we ran things was ‘turn
about.’ Croarkin would cook one week, and I
the next, and then we would have a clean-up
every Sunday morning. We baked our own
bread, and kept a few hens, which kept us supplied
with eggs. There was a man named Chapin
who had a little store in the village, and we
would take our gold dust there and trade it for
groceries.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE DITCH</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Did you discover much gold?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I worked with pretty good success,—nothing
startling. <i>I didn’t waste much, and
tried to live carefully.</i> I also <i>studied the business
opportunities</i> around, and persuaded some
of my friends to join me in buying and developing
a ‘ditch,’—a kind of aqueduct, to convey
water to diggers and washers. That proved
more profitable than digging for gold, and at
the end of the year, the others sold out to me,
took their earnings and went home. I stayed,
and bought up several other water-powers, until,
in 1856, I thought I had enough, and so I sold
out and came East.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“How much had you made, altogether?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About four thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was when Mr. Armour was twenty-four
years old,—his capital for beginning to do
business.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HE ENTERS THE GRAIN MARKET</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Did you return to Stockbridge?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A little while, but my ambition set in another
direction. I had been studying the
methods then used for moving the vast and
growing food products of the West, such as
grain and cattle, and I believed that I could
improve them and make money. The idea and
the field interested me and I decided to enter it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My standing was good, and I raised the
money, and bought what was then the largest
elevator in Milwaukee. This put me in contact
with the movement of grain. At that time,
John Plankington had been established in Milwaukee
a number of years, and, in partnership
with Frederick Layton, had built up a good
pork-packing concern. I bought in with those
gentlemen, and so came in contact with the
work I liked. One of my brothers, Herman,
had established himself in Chicago some time
before, in the grain-commission business. I got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>him to turn that over to the care of another
brother, Joseph, so that he might go to New
York as a member of the new firm, of which I
was a partner. It was important that the Milwaukee
and Chicago houses should be able to
ship to a house of their own in New York,—that
is, to themselves. Risks were avoided in
this way, and we were certain of obtaining all
that the ever-changing markets could offer us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When did you begin to build up your Chicago
interests?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were really begun, before the war, by
my brother Herman. When he went to New
York for us, we began adding a small packinghouse
to the Chicago commission branch. It
gradually grew with the growth of the West.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>MR. ARMOUR’S ACUTE PERCEPTION OF THE COMMERCIAL CONDITIONS FOR BUILDING UP A GREAT BUSINESS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Is there any one thing that accounts for the
immense growth of the packing industry here?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“System and the growth of the West did it.
Things were changing at startling rates in those
days. The West was growing fast. Its great
areas of production offered good profits to men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>who would handle and ship the products. Railway
lines were reaching out in new directions,
or increasing their capacities and lowering their
rates of transportation. These changes and the
growth of the country made the creation of a
food-gathering and delivering system necessary.
Other things helped. At that time
(1863), a great many could see that the war
was going to terminate favorably for the Union.
Farming operations had been enlarged by the
war demand and war prices. The state banking
system had been done away with, and we
had a uniform currency, available everywhere,
so that exchanges between the East and the
West had become greatly simplified. Nothing
more was needed than a steady watchfulness
of the markets by competent men in continuous
telegraphic communication with each other,
and who knew the legitimate demand and supply,
in order to sell all products quickly and
with profit.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SYSTEM AND GOOD MEASURE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Do you believe that system does so much?”
I ventured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“System and good measure. <i>Give a measure
heaped full and running over, and success is</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span><i>certain.</i> That is what it means to be the intelligent
servants of a great public need. We believed
in thoughtfully adopting every attainable
improvement, mechanical or otherwise, in the
methods and appliances for handling every
pound of grain or flesh. Right liberality and
right economy will do everything where a public
need is being served. Then, too, our</p>
<h3 class='c015'>METHODS</h3>
<p class='c017'>improved all the time. There was a time when
many parts of cattle were wasted, and the
health of the city injured by the refuse. Now,
by adopting the best known methods, nothing
is wasted; and buttons, fertilizers, glue and
other things are made cheaper and better for
the world in general, out of material that was
before a waste and a menace. I believe in finding
out the truth about all things—the very
latest truth or discovery,—and applying it.”</p>
<p class='c011'>“You attribute nothing to good fortune?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing!” Certainly the word came well
from a man whose energy, integrity, and business
ability made more money out of a ditch
than other men were making out of rich placers
in the gold region.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>THE TURNING POINT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“May I ask what you consider the turning-point
of your career?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The time when I began to save the money
I earned at the gold-fields.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>TRUTH</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What trait do you consider most essential
in young men?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truth. Let them get that. Young men
talk about getting capital to work with. Let
them get truth on board, and capital follows.
It’s easy enough to get that.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A GREAT ORATOR, AND A GREAT CHARITY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Did you always desire to follow a commercial,
rather than a professional life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not always. I have no talent in any other
direction; but I should have liked to be a great
orator.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Armour would say no more on this subject,
but his admiration for oratory has been
demonstrated in a remarkable way.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was after a Sunday morning discourse by
the splendid orator, Dr. Gunsaulus, at Plymouth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Church, Chicago, in which the latter had set
forth his views on the subject of educating children,
that Mr. Armour came forward and
said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You believe in those ideas of yours, do
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I certainly do,” said Dr. Gunsaulus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And would you carry them out if you had
the opportunity?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir,” said Mr. Armour, “if you will
give me five years of your time, I will give you
the money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But to carry out my ideas would take a
million dollars!” exclaimed Gunsaulus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have made a little money in my time,”
returned Mr. Armour. And so the famous Armour
Institute of Technology, to which its
founder has already given sums aggregating
$2,800,000, was associated with Mr. Armour’s
love of oratory.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of his lieutenants says that Gerritt Smith,
the old abolitionist, was Armour’s boyhood’s
hero, and that to-day Mr. Armour will go far
to hear a good speaker, often remarking that
he would have preferred to be a great orator
rather than a great capitalist.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>EASE IN HIS WORK</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“There is no need to ask you,” I continued,
“whether you believe in constant, hard labor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should not call it hard. I believe in close
application, of course, while laboring. Overwork
is not necessary to success. Every man
should have plenty of rest. I have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must rise early to be at your office at
half past seven?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but I go to bed early. I am not burning
the candle at both ends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The enormous energy of this man, who is too
modest to discuss it, is displayed in the most
normal manner. Though he sits all day at a
desk which has direct cable connection with
London, Liverpool, Calcutta, and other great
centers of trade, with which he is in constant
connection,—though he has at his hand long-distance
telephone connection with New York,
New Orleans, and San Francisco, and direct
wires from his room to almost all parts of the
world, conveying messages in short sentences
upon subjects which involve the moving of vast
amounts of stock and cereals, and the exchange
of millions in money, he is not, seemingly, an
overworked man. The great subjects to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>he gives calm, undivided attention from early
morning until evening, are laid aside with the
ease with which one doffs his raiment, and outside
of his office the cares weigh upon him no
more. His mind takes up new and simpler
things.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you do,” I inquired, “after your
hard day’s work,—think about it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all. I drive, take up home subjects,
and never think of the office until I return to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your sleep is never disturbed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A BUSINESS KING</h3>

<p class='c016'>And yet the business which this man forgets,
when he gathers children about him and moves
in his simple home circle, amounts in one year,
to over $100,000,000 worth of food products,
manufactured and distributed; the hogs killed,
1,750,000; the cattle, 1,080,000; the sheep,
625,000. Eleven thousand men are constantly
employed, and the wages paid them are over
$5,500,000; the railway cars owned and moving
about all parts of the country, four thousand;
the wagons of many kinds and of large number,
drawn by seven hundred and fifty horses. The
glue factory, employing seven hundred and fifty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>hands, makes over twelve million pounds of
glue. In his private office, it is he who takes
care of all the general affairs of this immense
world of industry, and yet at half-past four he
is done, and the whole subject is comfortably
off his mind.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>TRAINING YOUTH FOR BUSINESS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Do you believe in inherited abilities, or that
any boy can be taught and trained, and made a
great and able man?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I recognize inherited ability. Some people
have it, and only in a certain direction; but I
think men can be taught and trained so that
they become much better and more useful than
they would be, otherwise. Some boys require
more training and teaching than others. There
is prosperity for everyone, according to his
ability.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What would you do with those who are
naturally less competent than others?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Train them, and give them work according
to their ability. I believe that life is all right,
and that this difference which nature makes is
all right. Everything is good, and is coming
out satisfactorily, and we ought to make the
most of conditions, and try to use and improve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>everything. The work needed is here, and
everyone should set about doing it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When asked if he thought the chances for
young men as good to-day as they were when
he was young. “Yes,” he said, “I think so.
The world is changing every day and new fields
are constantly opening. We have new ideas,
new inventions, new methods of manufacture,
and new ways to-day everywhere. There is
plenty of room for any man who can do anything
well. The electrical field is a wonderful
one. There are other things equally good, and
the right man is never at a loss for an opportunity.
Provided he has some ability and good
sense to start with, is thrifty, honest and economical,
there is no reason why any young man
should not accumulate money and attain so
called success in life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When asked to what qualities he attributed
his own success, Mr. Armour said:   “I think
that thrift and economy had much to do with
it. I owe much to my mother’s training and to
a good line of Scotch ancestors, who have always
been thrifty and economical. As to my
business education, I never had any. I am, in
fact, a good deal like Topsy, ‘I just growed.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>My success has been largely a matter of organization.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have always made it a point to surround
myself with good men. I take them when they
are young and keep them just as long as I can.
Nearly all of the men I now have, have grown
up with me. Many of them have worked with
me for twenty years. They have started in at
low wages, and have been advanced until they
have reached the highest positions.” Mr. Armour
thinks that most men who accumulate
a large amount of money, inherited the money-making
instinct. The power of making and
accumulating money, he says, is as much a
natural gift as are those of a singer or an artist.
“The germs of the power to make money must
be in the mind. Take, for instance, the people
we have working with us. I can get millions
of good bookkeepers or accountants, but not
more than one out of five hundred in all of those
I have employed has made a great success as an
organizer or trader.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Armour is a great believer in young men
and young brains. He never discharges a man
if he can possibly avoid it. If the man is not
doing good work where he is, he puts him in
some other department, but never discharges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>him if he can find him other work. He will
not, however, tolerate intemperance, laziness or
getting into debt. Some time ago a policeman
entered his office. In answer to Mr. Armour’s
question, “What do you want here?” he replied:
“I want to garnishee one of your men’s
wages for debt.” “Indeed,” said Mr. Armour,
“and who is the man?” Asking the officer
into his private room he sent for the debtor.
“How long have you been in debt?” asked Mr.
Armour. The clerk replied that he had been
behind for twenty years and could not seem to
catch up. “But you get a good salary, don’t
you?” “Yes, but I can’t get out of debt.”
“But you must get out, or you must leave here,”
said Mr. Armour. “How much do you owe?”
The clerk then gave the amount, which was
less than a thousand-dollars. “Well,” said Mr.
Armour, handing him a check, “there is
enough to pay all your debts, and if I hear of
you again getting into debt, you will have to
leave.” The clerk paid his debts and remodeled
his life on a cash basis.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>PROMPT TO ACT</h3>

<p class='c016'>In illustration of Mr. Armour’s aptitude for
doing business, and his energy, it is related that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>when, in 1893, local forces planned to defeat
him in the grain market, and everyone was crying
that at last the great Goliath had met his
David, he was all energy. He had ordered immense
quantities of wheat. The opposition had
shrewdly secured every available place of storage,
and rejoiced that the great packer, having
no place to store his property, would suffer immense
loss, and must capitulate. He foresaw
the fray and its dangers, and, going over on
Goose Island, bought property at any price, and
began the construction of immense elevators.
The town was placarded with the truth that
anyone could get work at Armour’s elevators.
No one believed they could be done in time, but
three shifts of men working night and day, often
under the direct supervision of the millionaire,
gradually forced the work ahead, and when, on
the appointed day, the great grain-ships began
to arrive, the opposition realized failure. The
vessels began to pour the contents of their immense
holds into these granaries, and the fight
was over.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>FORESIGHT</h3>

<p class='c016'>The foresight that sent him to New York in
1864, to sell pork, brought him back from Europe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>in 1893, months before the impending
panic was dreamed of by other merchants. It
is told of him that he called all his head men to
New York, and announced to them:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gentlemen, there’s going to be financial
trouble soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Mr. Armour,” they said, “you must
be mistaken. Things were never better. You
have been ill, and are suddenly apprehensive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no,” he said, “I’m not. There is going
to be trouble;” and he gave as his reasons certain
conditions which existed in nearly all countries,
which none of those present had thought
of. “Now,” said he to the first of his many
lieutenants, “how much will you need to run
your department until next year?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The head man named his need. The others
were asked, each in turn, the same question, and,
when all were through, he counted up, and,
turning to the company, said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gentlemen, go back and borrow all you
need in Chicago, on my credit. Use my name
for all it will bring in the way of loans.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>FOREARMED AGAINST PANIC</h3>

<p class='c016'>The lieutenants returned, and the name of
Armour was strained to its utmost limit. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>all had been borrowed, the financial flurry suddenly
loomed up, but it did not worry the great
packer. In his vaults were $8,000,000 in
gold. All who had loaned him at interest then
hurried to his doors, fearing that he also was
imperiled. They found him supplied with ready
money, and able to compel them to wait until
the stipulated time of payment, or to force them
to abandon their claims of interest for their
money, and so tide him over the unhappy period.
It was a master stroke, and made the
name of the great packer a power in the world
of finance.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SOME SECRETS OF SUCCESS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Do you consider your financial decisions
which you make quickly to be brilliant intuitions?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never did anything worth doing by accident,
nor did anything I have come that way.
No, I never decide anything without knowing
the conditions of the market, and never begin
unless satisfied concerning the conclusion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not everyone could do that,” I said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot do everything. Every man can do
something, and there is plenty to do,—never
more than now. The problems to be solved are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>greater now than ever before. <i>Never was there
more need of able men. I am looking for
trained men all the time.</i> More money is being
offered for them everywhere than formerly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you consider that <i>happiness</i> consists in
labor alone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>It consists in doing something for others.</i>
If you give the world better material, better
measure, better opportunities for living respectably,
there is happiness in that. You cannot
give the world anything without labor, and
there is no satisfaction in anything but such
labor as looks toward doing this, and does it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>What Miss Mary E. Proctor Did to Popularize Astronomy</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>“YOU can never know what your possibilities
are,” said Miss Proctor, “till
you have put yourself to the test.
There are many, many women who long to
do something, and could succeed, if they would
only banish their doubts, and plunge in. For
example, I was not at all sure that I could
interest audiences with talks on astronomy, but,
in 1893, I began, and since then have given
between four and five hundred lectures.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Proctor is so busy spreading knowledge
of the beauties and marvels of the heavens,
that she was at home in New York for only a
two days’ interval between tours, when she consented
to talk to me about her work. This talk
showed such enthusiasm and whole-souled devotion
to the theme that it is easy to understand
Miss Proctor’s success as a lecturer, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>she is physically diminutive, and is very domestic
in her tastes.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AUDIENCES ARE APPRECIATIVE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“I am always nervous in going before an
audience,” she said, “but there is so much I
want to tell them that I have no time at all to
think of myself. I find that if the lecturer is
really interested in the subject, those who come
to listen usually are; and it is certainly true, as
I have learned by going upon the platform, tired
out from a long journey, that you cannot expect
enthusiasm in your audience, unless you
are enthusiastic yourself. But I think that audiences
are very responsive and appreciative of
intelligent efforts to interest them, and, therefore,
I am sure, that if a woman possesses, or
can acquire a thorough knowledge of some practical,
popular subject, and has enthusiasm and
a fair knowledge of human nature, she can attain
success on the lecture platform.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The field is broad, and far from over-crowded,
and it yields bountifully to those who
are willing to toil and wait. There is Miss
Roberts, for instance, who commands large
audiences for her lectures on music; and Mrs.
Lemcke, who has been remarkably successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>in her practical talks on cooking; and Mary
E. Booth, who gives wonderfully instructive
and entertaining lectures on the revelations of
the microscope; and Miss Very, who takes audiences
of children on most delightful and
profitable imaginary trips to places of importance.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>LECTURES TO CHILDREN</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Children, by the way, are my most satisfactory
audiences. Grown-up people never become
so absorbed. It is the greatest pleasure of my
lecturing to talk to the little tots, and watch
them drink it all in. Indeed, I prepared my
very first lecture for children, but didn’t deliver
it. That episode marked the beginning of my
career as a lecturer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you ask me to tell you about it? My
father, Richard A. Proctor, wrote, as you know,
many books on popular astronomy. When I
was a girl I did not read them very carefully;
my education at South Kensington, London,
following a musical and artistic direction. In
fact, I was ambitious to become a painter. But
when my father died, in 1888, I found comfort
in reading his books all over again; and as he
had drilled me to write for his periodical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>‘<i>Knowledge</i>,’ I began to write articles on astronomy
for anyone who would accept them.
One day, in the spring of 1893, I received a
letter from Mrs. Potter Palmer, asking me if I
would talk to an audience of children in the
Children’s Building at the World’s Fair. The
idea of lecturing was new to me, but I decided
that I would try, at any rate, and so I took
great pains to prepare a talk that I thought the
children would understand, and be interested in.
But when I reached the building, I found an
audience, not of children, but of men and women.
<i>There was hardly a child in all the assembled
five hundred people.</i> It would never do
to give them the childish talk I had prepared,
and as it was my first attempt to talk from a
platform, you can imagine my state of mind.
I was determined, however, that my first effort
should not be a fiasco, so I stepped out upon
the platform and talked about the things that
had most interested me in my father’s books
and conversations.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A LESSON IN LECTURING</h3>

<p class='c016'>“I have lectured a great many times since
then, but my first lecture was the most trying.
I am now glad that things happened as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>did, for that experience taught me a valuable
lesson. I learned not to commit my talks to
memory, but merely to have the topics and facts
and general arrangement of the lecture well in
mind. By this method, I can change and adapt
myself to my audience at any time; and I often
have to do this. I am able to feel intuitively
whether I have gained my listeners’ sympathy
and interest, and when I feel that I have not, I
immediately take another tack. Another great
advantage of not committing what you are going
to say to memory, word for word, is the
added color and animation and spontaneity
which the conversational tone and manner gives
the lecture.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE STEREOPTICON</h3>

<p class='c016'>“My stereopticon pictures of the heavenly
bodies are of great help to me. They naturally
add much to the interest, and are really a revelation
to most of my audiences, for the reason
that they show things that can never be seen
with the naked eye. How my father would
have delighted in them, and how effectively he
would have used them. But celestial photography
had not been made practical at the time of
his death; it is, indeed, quite a new art, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>its general principles are very simple.
A special lens and photographic plate are adjusted
in the telescope, and the plate is exposed
as in an ordinary camera, except that the exposure
is much longer. It usually continues for
about four hours, the greater the length of time
the greater being the number of stars that will
be seen in the photograph. After the developing,
these stars appear as mere specks on the
plate. That they are so small is not surprising,
for most of them are stars that are never seen
by the eye alone. When the photograph is enlarged
by the stereopticon, the result is like looking
at a considerable portion of the heavens
through a powerful telescope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The children utter exclamations of delight
when they see the pictures,—the children, dear,
imaginative little souls, it is my ambition to devote
more and more of my time to them, and
finally talk and write for them altogether. They
are greatly impressed with the new world in
the skies which is opened to them, and I like to
think that these early impressions will give them
an understanding and appreciation of the wonders
of astronomy that will always be a pleasure
to them.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>“STORIES FROM STAR LAND”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“For the children, my first book, ‘Stories
From Starland,’ was written. I tried to weave
into it poetical and romantic ideas, that appeal
to the imaginative mind of the child, and
quicken the interest without any sacrifice of accuracy
in the facts with which I deal. I wrote
the book in a week. The publisher came to me
one Saturday, and told me that he would like a
children’s book on astronomy. I devoted all my
days to it till the following Saturday night, and
on Monday morning took the completed manuscript
to the publishing house. They seemed
very much surprised that it should be finished
so soon; but as a matter of fact it was not much
more than the manual labor of writing out the
manuscript that I did in that week. <i>The little
book itself is the result of ten years’ thought
and study.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>“It is much the same with my lectures. I
deliver them in a hasty, conversational tone, and
they seem, as one of my listeners told me recently,
to be ‘just offhand chats.’ But in
reality I devote a great deal of labor to them,
and am constantly adding new facts and new
ideas.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>CONCENTRATION OF ATTENTION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I learned very soon after I began my work,
that <i>I must give myself up to it absolutely</i> if I
were to achieve success. There could be no side
issues, nothing else to absorb any of my energy,
or take any of my thought or time. One of the
first things I did was to take a thorough course
in singing, for the purpose of acquiring complete
control of my voice. I put aside all social functions,
of which I am rather fond and have since
devoted my days and nights to astronomy,—not
that I work at night, except when I lecture;
I rest and retire early, so that in the morning
I may have the spirit and enthusiasm necessary
to do good work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Enthusiasm</i>, it seems to me, is an important
factor in success. It combats discouragement,
makes work a pleasure, and sacrifices easier.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A great many women fail in special fields
of endeavor, who might succeed if they were
willing to sacrifice something, and would not
let the distractions creep in. There is more in
a woman’s life to divert her attention from a
single purpose than in a man’s; but if the woman
has chosen some line of effort that is worthy to
be called life work, and if—refusing to be drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>aside,—she keeps her eyes steadfastly upon the
goal, I believe that she is almost certain to
achieve success.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>The Boyhood Experience of President Schurman of Cornell University</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>AT ten years of age, he was a country lad
on a backwoods farm on Prince Edward
Island.</p>

<p class='c011'>At thirteen, he had become a clerk in a country
store, at a salary of thirty dollars a year.</p>

<p class='c011'>At eighteen, he was a college student, supporting
himself by working in the evenings as a
bookkeeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>At twenty, he had won a scholarship in the
University of London, in competition with all
other Canadian students.</p>

<p class='c011'>At twenty-five, he was professor of philosophy,
Acadia College, Nova Scotia.</p>

<p class='c011'>At thirty-eight, he was appointed President
of Cornell University.</p>

<p class='c011'>At forty-four, he was chairman of President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>McKinley’s special commission to the Philippines.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this summary is epitomized the career of
Jacob Gould Schurman. It is a romance of
real life such as is not unfamiliar in America.
Mr. Schurman’s career differs from that of
some other self-made men, however. Instead
of heaping up millions upon millions, he has
applied his talents to winning the intellectual
prizes of life, and has made his way, unaided,
to the front rank of the leaders in thought and
learning in this country. His career is a source
of inspiration to all poor boys who have their
own way to make in the world, for he has
won his present honors by his own unaided
efforts.</p>

<p class='c011'>President Schurman says of his early life:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is impossible for the boy of to-day, no
matter in what part of the country he is
brought up, to appreciate the life of Prince Edward
Island as it was forty years ago. At that
time, it had neither railroads nor daily newspapers,
nor any of the dozen other things that
are the merest commonplaces nowadays, even
to the boys of the country districts. I did not
see a railroad until late in my ’teens. I was
never inside of a theatre until after I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>twenty. The only newspaper that came to my
father’s house was a little provincial weekly.
The only books the house contained were a
few standard works,—such as the Bible, Bunyan’s
‘Pilgrim’s Progress,’ Fox’s ‘Book of
Martyrs,’ and a few others of that class. Remember,
too, that this was not back at the beginning
of the century, but little more than a
generation ago, for I was born in the year
1854.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father had cleared away the land on
which our house stood. He was a poor man,
but no poorer than his neighbors. No amount
of land, and no amount of work could yield
much more than the necessaries of life in that
time and place. There were eight children in
our family, and there was work for all of us.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A LONG TRAMP TO SCHOOL</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Our parents were anxious to have their
children acquire at least an elementary education;
and so, summer and winter, we tramped
the mile and a half that lay between our house
and the district school, and the snow often fell
to the depth of five or six feet on the island,
and sometimes, when it was at its worst, our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>father would drive us all to school in a big
sleigh. But no weather was bad enough to
keep us away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would be looked upon as a poor kind
of school, nowadays, I suppose. The scholars
were of all ages, and everything, from A,-B,-C,
to the Rule of Three, was taught by the one
teacher. But whatever may have been its deficiencies,
the work of the school was thorough.
The teacher was an old-fashioned drillmaster,
and whatever he drove into our heads he put
there to stay. I went to this school until I
was thirteen, and by that time I had learned to
read and write and spell and figure with considerable
accuracy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the age of thirteen, I left home. I had
formed no definite plans for the future. I
merely wanted to get into a village, and to earn
some money.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father got me a place in the nearest
town,—Summerside,—a village of about one
thousand inhabitants. For my first year’s
work I was to receive thirty dollars and my
board. Think of that, young men of to-day!
Thirty dollars a year for working from seven
in the morning until ten at night! But I was
glad to get the place. It was a start in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>world, and the little village was like a city to
my country eyes.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HE ALWAYS SUPPORTED HIMSELF</h3>

<p class='c016'>“From the time I began working in the store
until to-day, I have always supported myself,
and during all the years of my boyhood I never
received a penny that I did not earn myself.
At the end of my first year, I went to a larger
store in the same town, where I was to receive
sixty dollars a year and my board. I kept this
place for two years, and then I gave it up,
against the wishes of my employer, because I
had made up my mind that I wanted to get a
better education. I determined to go to college.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not know how I was going to do this,
except that it must be by my own efforts. I
had saved about eighty dollars from my store-keeping,
and that was all the money I had in
the world.” <i>Out of a hundred and fifty dollars,
the only cash he received as his first earnings
during three years, young Schurman had saved
eighty dollars; this he invested in the beginnings
of an education.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>“When I told my employer of my plan, he
tried to dissuade me from it. He pointed out
the difficulties in the way of my going to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>college, and offered to double my pay if I would
stay in the store.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE TURNING-POINT OF HIS LIFE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“That was the turning-point in my life. On
one side was the certainty of one hundred and
twenty dollars a year, and the prospect of promotion
as fast as I deserved it. Remember
what one hundred and twenty dollars meant
in Prince Edward Island, and to a poor boy
who had never possessed such a sum in his life.
On the other side was my hope of obtaining an
education. I knew that it involved hard work
and self-denial, and there was the possibility of
failure in the end. But my mind was made up.
I would not turn back. I need not say that I
do not regret that early decision, although I
think that I should have made a successful
storekeeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“With my eighty dollars capital, I began to
attend the village high school, to get my
preparation for college. I had only one year to
do it in. My money would not last longer than
that. I recited in Latin, Greek and algebra,
all on the same day, and for the next forty
weeks I studied harder than I ever had before
or have since. At the end of the year I entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the competitive examination for a scholarship
in Prince of Wales College, at Charlotte Town,
on the island. I had small hope of winning it,
my preparation had been so hasty and incomplete.
But when the result was announced, I
found that I had not only won the scholarship
from my county, but stood first of all the competitors
on the island.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The scholarship I had won amounted to
only sixty dollars a year. It seems little
enough, but I can say now, after nearly thirty
years, that the winning of it was the greatest
success I have ever had. I have had other rewards,
which, to most persons, would seem
immeasurably greater, but with this difference:
that first success was essential; without it I
could not have gone on. The others I could
have done without, if it had been necessary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For two years young Schurman attended
Prince of Wales College. He lived on his
scholarship and what he could earn by keeping
books for one of the town storekeepers, spending
less than one hundred dollars during the
entire college year. Afterwards, he taught a
country school for a year, and then went to
Acadia College in Nova Scotia to complete his
college course.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>A SPLENDID COLLEGE RECORD</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>One of Mr. Schurman’s fellow-students in
Acadia says that he was remarkable chiefly for
taking every prize to which he was eligible. In
his senior year, he learned of a scholarship in
the University of London, to be competed for
by the students of Canadian colleges. The
scholarship paid five hundred dollars a year for
three years. The young student in Acadia was
ambitious to continue his studies in England,
and saw in this offer his opportunity. He tried
the examination and won the prize.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the three years in the University of
London, Mr. Schurman became deeply interested
in the study of philosophy, and decided
that he had found in it his life work. He was
eager to go to Germany and study under the
great leaders of philosophic thought. A way
was opened for him, through the offer of the
Hibbard Society in London; the prize being a
traveling fellowship with two thousand dollars
a year. The honor men of the great English
universities like Oxford and Cambridge were
among the competitors, but the poor country
boy from Prince Edward Island was again successful,
greatly to the surprise of the others.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>At the end of his course in Germany, Mr.
Schurman, then a Doctor of Philosophy, returned
to Acadia College to become a teacher
there. Soon afterwards, he was called to Dalhousie
University, at Halifax, Nova Scotia.
In 1886, when a chair of philosophy was established
at Cornell, President White, who once
met the brilliant young Canadian, called him to
that position. Two years later, Dr. Schurman
became Dean of the Sage School of Philosophy
at Cornell; and, in 1892, when the President’s
chair became vacant, he was placed at the head
of the great university. At that time, he was
only thirty-eight years of age.</p>

<p class='c011'>President Schurman is a man of great intellectual
power, and an inspiring presence.
Though one of the youngest college presidents
in the country, he is one of the most successful,
and under his leadership Cornell has been very
prosperous. He is deeply interested in all the
affairs of young men, and especially those who,
as he did, must make their own way in the
world. He said, the other day:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Though I am no longer engaged directly in
teaching, I should think my work a failure if
I did not feel that my influence on the young
men with whom I come in contact is as direct
and helpful as that of a teacher could be.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>The Story of John Wanamaker</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>IN a plain two-story dwelling, on the outskirts
of Philadelphia, the future merchant
prince was born, July 11, 1837.
His parents were Americans in humble station;
his mother being of that sturdy Pennsylvania
Dutch stock which has no parallel except the
Scotch for ruggedness. His father, a hardworking
man, owned a brickyard in the close
vicinity of the family residence. Little John
earned his first money, seven big copper cents,
by assisting his father. He was too small to
do much, but turned the bricks every morning
as they lay drying in the summer sun. As he
grew older and stronger, the boy was given
harder tasks around the brickyard.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went to school a little, not much, and he
assisted his mother in the house a great deal.
His father died when John was fourteen, and
this changed the whole course of his life. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>abandoned the brickyard and secured a place
in a bookstore owned by Barclay Lippincott,
on Market Street, Philadelphia, at a salary of
one dollar and twenty-five cents a week.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a four-mile walk from his home to his
place of business. Cheerfully he trudged this
distance morning and night; purchasing an
apple or a roll each noon for luncheon, and
giving his mother all the money that he saved.
He used to deny himself every comfort, and
the only other money that he ever spent was on
books for his mother. This seems to have been
the boy’s chief source of pleasure at that period.
Even to-day, he says of his mother: “Her
smile was a bit of heaven, and it never faded
out of her face till her dying day.” Mrs.
Wanamaker lived to see her son famous and
wealthy.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS CAPITAL AT FOURTEEN</h3>

<p class='c016'>John Wanamaker, the boy, had no single
thing in all his surroundings to give him an
advantage over any one of hundreds of other
boys in the city of Philadelphia. Indeed, there
were hundreds and hundreds of other boys of
his own age for whom anyone would have felt
safe in prophesying a more notable career. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>capital was not in money. Very few boys in
all that great city had less money than John
Wanamaker, and comparatively few families
of average position but were better off in the
way of worldly goods. John Wanamaker’s
capital, that stood him in such good stead in
after life, comprised good health, good habits,
a clean mind, thrift in money matters, and tireless
devotion to whatever he thought to be duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>People who were well acquainted with John
Wanamaker when he was a book publisher’s
boy, say that he was exceptionally promising as
a boy; that he was studious as well as attentive
to business. He did not take kindly to rough
play, or do much playing of any kind. He was
earnest in his work, unusually earnest for a
boy. And he was saving of his money.</p>

<p class='c011'>When, a little later, he went to a Market
street clothing house and asked for a place, he
had no difficulty in getting it, nor had he any
trouble in holding it, and here he could earn
twenty-five cents a week more wages.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>TOWER HALL CLOTHING STORE</h3>

<p class='c016'>Men who worked with him in the Tower
Hall Clothing Store say that he was always
bright, willing, accommodating, and very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>seldom out of temper. His effort was to be
first at the store in the morning, and he was
very likely to be one of the last, if not the last,
at the store in the evening. If there was an
errand, he was always prompt and glad to do
it. And so the store people liked him, and the
proprietor liked him, and, when he began to
sell clothing, the customers liked him. He was
considerate of their interests. He did not try
to force undesirable goods upon them. He
treated them so that when they came again they
would be apt to ask, “Where is John?”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS AMBITION AND POWER AS AN ORGANIZER AT SIXTEEN</h3>

<p class='c016'>Colonel Bennett, the proprietor of Tower
Hall, said of him at this time:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“John was certainly the most ambitious boy
I ever saw. I used to take him to lunch with
me, and he used to tell me how he was going to
be a great merchant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was very much interested in the temperance
cause; and had not been with me long before
he persuaded most of the employees in
the store to join the temperance society to
which he belonged. He was always organizing
something. He seemed to be a natural-born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>organizer. This faculty is largely accountable
for his great success in after life.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE Y. M. C. A.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Young Wanamaker’s religious principles
were always at the forefront in whatever he
did. His interest in Sunday School work, and
his skill as an organizer became well known.
And so earnestly did he engage in the work of
the Young Men’s Christian Association, that
he was appointed the first salaried secretary of
the Philadelphia branch, at one thousand
dollars a year. Never since has a secretary enrolled
so many members in the same space of
time. He passed seven years in this arduous
work.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>OAK HALL</h3>

<p class='c016'>He saved his money; and, at twenty-four,
formed a partnership with his brother-in-law
Nathan Brown, and opened Oak Hall Clothing
store, in April, 1861. Their united capital was
only $3,500; yet Wanamaker’s capital of popular
good-will was very great. He was already
a great power in the city. I can never forget
the impression made upon my mind, after he
had been in business but a few months, when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>visited his Bethany Sunday School, established
in one of the most unpromising sections of the
city, which had become already a factor for
good, with one of the largest enrollments in
the world. And he was foremost in every form
of philanthropic work.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was because of his great capacity to do
business that Wanamaker had been able to
“boom” the Young Men’s Christian Association
work. He knew how to do it. And he
could “boom” a Sunday School, or anything
else that he took hold of. He had</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A HEAD BUILT FOR BUSINESS,</h3>
<p class='c017'>whatever the business might be. And as for
Oak Hall, he knew just what to do with it.</p>
<p class='c011'><i>The first thing he did was to multiply his
working capital by getting the best help obtainable
for running the store.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>At the very outset, John Wanamaker did
what almost any other business man would
have stood aghast at. He chose the best man
he knew as a salesman in the clothing business
in Philadelphia,—the man of the most winning
personality who could attract trade,—and
agreed to pay him $1,350 for a year,—one-third
of the entire capital of the new concern.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>It has been a prime principle with this merchant
prince not only to deal fairly with his
employees, but to make it an object for them
to earn money for him and to stand by him.
Capacity has been the first demand. <i>He engaged
the very best men to be had.</i> There are
to-day dozens of men in his employ who receive
larger salaries than are paid to cabinet
ministers. All the employees of the Thirteenth
Street store, which he occupied in 1877, participate
in <i>a yearly division of profits. Their
share at the end of the first year amounted to
$109,439.68.</i></p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS RELATION TO CUSTOMERS</h3>

<p class='c016'>A considerable portion of the trade of the
new store came from people in the country districts.
Mr. Wanamaker had a way of getting
close to them and gaining their good will. He
understood human nature. He put his customer
at ease. He showed interest in the things that
interested the farmer. An old employee of the
firm says: “John used to put a lot of chestnuts
in his pocket along in the fall and winter, and,
when he had one of these countrymen in tow,
he’d slip a few of the nuts into the visitor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>hand and both would go munching about the
store.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Wanamaker was the first to introduce the
“one-price system” into the clothing trade. It
was the universal rule in those days, in the
clothing trade, not to mark the prices plainly
on the goods that were for sale. Within rather
liberal bounds, the salesman got what he could
from the customer. Mr. Wanamaker, after a
time, instituted at Oak Hall the plan of “but
one price and that plainly marked.” In doing
this he followed the cue of Stewart, who was
the first merchant in the country to introduce it
into the dry-goods business.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great Wanamaker store of 1877 went
much further:—</p>

<p class='c011'>He announced that <i>those who bought goods
of him were to be satisfied with what they
bought, or have their money back</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the old mercantile houses of the city, this
seemed like committing business suicide.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was, also, unheard-of that special effort
should be made to add to the comfort of visitors;
to make them welcome whether they cared
to buy or not; to induce them to look upon the
store as a meeting-place, a rendezvous, a resting-place,—a
sort of city home, almost.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>THE MERCHANT’S ORGANIZING FACULTY</h3>
</div>
<p class='c017'>was so great that General Grant once remarked
to George W. Childs that Wanamaker would
have been a great general if his lot had been
that of army service.</p>
<p class='c011'>Wanamaker used to buy goods of Stewart,
and the New York merchant remarked to a
friend: “If young Wanamaker lives, he will
be a greater merchant than I ever was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometime in recent years, since Wanamaker
bought the Stewart store, he said to Frank G.
Carpenter:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“A. T. Stewart was a genius. I have been
surprised again and again as I have gone
through the Broadway and Tenth Street building,
to find what a knowledge he had of the
needs of a mercantile establishment. Mr. Stewart
put up a building which is to-day, I believe,
better arranged than any of the modern structures.
He seemed to know just what was
needed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I met him often when I was a young man.
I have reason to think that he took a liking to
me. One day, I remember, I was in his woolen
department buying some stuffs for my store
here, when he came up to me and asked if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>would be in the store for fifteen minutes longer.
I replied that I would. At the end of fifteen
minutes he returned and handed me a slip of
paper, saying:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Young man, I understand that you have
a mission school in Philadelphia; use that for
it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before I could reply he had left. I looked
down at the slip of paper. It was a check for
one thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Wanamaker early showed himself the peer
of the greatest merchants. He created the
combination or department store. He lifted
the retail clothing business to a higher plane
than it had ever before reached. In ten years
from the time he began to do business for himself,
he had absorbed the space of forty-five
other tenants and become the leading merchant
of his native city. Four years later, he had
purchased, for $450,000, the freight depot of
the Pennsylvania Railroad, covering the entire
square where his present great store is located.
The firm name became simply John Wanamaker.
His lieutenants and business partners
therein are his son Thomas B. Wanamaker,
and Robert C. Ogden. Their two Philadelphia
establishments alone do a business of between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>$30,000,000 and $40,000,000 annually. Mr.
Wanamaker’s private fortune is one of the most
substantial in America.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>ATTENTION TO DETAILS</h3>

<p class='c016'>Yet in all these years he has been early and
late at the store, as he was when a boy. He
has always seen to it that customers have prompt
and careful attention. He early made the rule
that if a sale was missed, a written reason must
be rendered by the salesman. There was no
hap-hazard business in that store,—nothing of
the happy-go-lucky style. Each man must be
alert, wide-awake, attentive, or there was no
place for him at Oak Hall.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MOST RIGID ECONOMY</h3>
<p class='c017'>has been always a part of the system. It is told
of him that, in the earlier days of Oak Hall,
he used to gather up the short pieces of string
that came in on parcels, make them into a
bunch, and see that they were used when
bundles were to be tied. He also had a habit
of smoothing out old newspapers, and seeing
that they were used as wrappers for such things
as did not require a better grade of paper.</p>
<p class='c011'>The story has been often related of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>day’s business at the original store in ’61, when
Wanamaker delivered the sales by wheeling a
push-cart.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>ADVERTISING</h3>

<p class='c016'>The first day’s business made a cash profit
of thirty-eight dollars; and the whole sum was
invested in one advertisement in the next day’s
“<i>Inquirer</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His advertising methods were unique; he
paid for the best talent he could get in this line.</p>

<p class='c011'>Philadelphia woke one morning to find “W.
&amp; B.” in the form of six-inch square posters
stuck up all over the town. There was not another
letter, no hint, just “W. &amp; B.” Such
things are common enough now, but then the
whole city was soon talking and wondering
what this sign meant. After a few days, a
second poster modestly stated that Wanamaker
&amp; Brown had begun to sell clothing at Oak
Hall. Before long there were great signs, each
100 feet in length, painted on special fences
built in a dozen places about the city, particularly
near the railroad stations. These told of
the new firm and were the first of a class that
is now seen all over the country. Afterwards</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>BALLOONS</h3>
</div>
<p class='c017'>more than twenty feet high were sent up, and
a suit of clothes was given to each person who
brought one of them back. Whole counties
were stirred up by the balloons. It was grand
advertising, imitated since by all sorts of
people. When the balloon idea struck the Oak
Hall management it was quickly found that the
only way to get these air-ships was to make
them, and so, on the roof of the store, the cotton
cloth was cut and oiled and put together.
Being well built, and tied very tightly at the
neck, they made long flights and some of them
were used over and over again. In one instance,
a balloon remained for more than six
months in a cranberry swamp, and when the
great bag was discovered, slowly swaying in
the breeze, among the bushes, the frightened
Jerseymen thought they had come upon an
elephant, or, maybe, a survivor of the mastodons.
This made more advertising of the very
best kind for the clothing store,—the kind that
excites interested, complimentary talk.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES</h3>

<p class='c016'>Genius consists in taking advantage of opportunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>quite as much as in making them.
Here was a young man doing things in an advertising
way regardless of the custom of the
business world, and with a wonderful knowledge
of human nature. He took commonsense
advantage of opportunities that were open to
everybody.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon after the balloon experience, tally-ho
coaching began to be a Philadelphia fad of the
very exclusives. Immediately afterwards a
crack coach was secured, and six large and
spirited horses were used instead of four, and
Oak Hall employees, dressed in the style of the
most ultra coaching set, traversed the country
in every direction, scattering advertising matter
to the music of the horn. Sometimes they
would be a week on a trip. No wonder Oak
Hall flourished. It was kept in the very front
of the procession all the time.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little later, in the yachting season, the
whole town was attracted and amused by processions
and scatterings of men, each wearing
a wire body frame that supported a thin staff
from which waved a wooden burgee, or
pointed flag reminding them of Oak Hall.
Nearly two hundred of these prototypes of the
“Sandwich man” were often out at one time.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>But it was not only in the quick catching of
a novel advertising thought that the new house
was making history; in newspaper advertising,
it was even further in advance. The statements
of store news were crisp and unhackneyed, and
the first artistic illustrations ever put into advertisements
were used there. So high was
the grade of this picture-work that art schools
regularly clipped the illustrations as models;
and the world-famous Shakespearian scholar,
Dr. Horace Howard Furness, treasured the
original sketches of “The Seven Ages” as
among the most interesting in his unique collection.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>PUSH AND PERSISTENCE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“The chief reason,” said Mr. Wanamaker
upon one occasion, “that everybody is not successful
is the fact that they have not enough
persistency. I always advise young men who
write me on the subject to do one thing well,
throwing all their energies into it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To his employees he once said:—“We are
very foolish people if we shut our ears and eyes
to what other people are doing. I often pick
up things from strangers. As you go along,
pick up suggestions here and there, jot them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>down and send them along. Even writing them
down helps to concentrate your mind on that
part of the work. You need not be afraid of
overstepping the mark. The more we push
each other, the better.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“TO WHAT, MR. WANAMAKER, DO YOU ATTRIBUTE YOUR GREAT SUCCESS?”</h3>

<p class='c016'>In reply to this question when asked, he replied:—“To
thinking, toiling, trying, and
trusting in God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A serene confidence in a guiding power has
always been one of the Wanamaker characteristics.
He is always calm. Under the greatest
stress he never loses his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one physical particular, Mr. Wanamaker
is very remarkable. He can work continually
for a long time without sleep and without evidence
of strain, and make up for it by a good
rest afterwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>When upon one occasion he was asked to
name the essentials of success, he replied,
curtly:—“I might write a volume trying to
tell you how to succeed. <i>One way is to not be
above taking a hint from a master.</i> I don’t
care to tell why I succeeded; because I object
to talking about myself,—it isn’t modest.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>A feature of his make-up that has contributed
largely to his success is his ability to concentrate
his thoughts. No matter how trivial
the subject brought before him, he takes it up
with the appearance of one who has nothing
else on his mind.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS VIEWS ON BUSINESS</h3>

<p class='c016'>When asked whether the small tradesmen
has any “show” to-day against the great department
stores, he said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“All of the great stores were small at one time.
Small stores will keep on developing into big
ones. You wouldn’t expect a man to put an
iron band about his business in order to prevent
expansion, would you? There are, according
to statistics, a greater number of prosperous
small stores in the city than ever before.
What better proof do you want?</p>

<p class='c011'>“The department store is a natural product,
evolved from conditions that exist as a result
of fixed trade laws. Executive capacity, combined
with command of capital, finds opportunity
in these conditions, which are harmonious
with the irresistible determination of the
producer to meet the consumer directly, and
of merchandise to find distribution along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>lines of least resistance. Reduced prices stimulate
consumption, and increase employment;
and it is sound opinion that the increased employment
created by the department stores goes
to women without curtailing that of men. In
general it may be stated that large retail stores
have shortened the hours of labor; and by
systematic discipline have made it lighter. The
small store is harder upon the sales-person and
clerk. The effects upon the character and
capacity of the employees are good. A well
ordered, modern retail store is the means of
education in spelling, writing, English language,
system and method. Thus it becomes
to the ambitious and serious employees, in a
small way, a university, in which character is
broadened by intelligent instruction practically
applied.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When asked if a man with means but no
experience would be safe in embarking in a
mercantile business, he replied quickly:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“A man can’t drive a horse who has never
seen one. No; a man must have training, must
know how to buy and sell; only experience
teaches that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I have heard people marvel at the unbroken
upward course of Mr. Wanamaker’s career,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and lament that they so often make mistakes.
But hear him:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who does not make mistakes? Why, if I
were to think only of the mistakes I have made,
I should be miserable indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I have heard it said a hundred times that Mr.
Wanamaker started when success was easy.
Here is what he says himself about it:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I could succeed as well now as in the
past. It seems to me that the conditions of to-day
are even more favorable to success than
when I was a boy. There are better facilities
for doing business, and more business to be
done. Information in the shape of books and
newspapers is now in the reach of all, and the
young man has two opportunities where he
formerly had one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are much more afraid of combinations
of capital than we have any reason for being.
Competition regulates everything of that kind.
No organization can make immense profits for
any length of time without its field soon swarming
with competitors. It requires brain and
muscle to manage any kind of business, and
the same elements which have produced business
success in the past will produce it now, and
will always produce it.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>PUBLIC SERVICE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>With the exception of his term of service as
postmaster-general of the United States in
President Harrison’s cabinet—a service which
was marked by great executive ability and the
institution of many reforms,—Mr. Wanamaker
has devoted his attention almost entirely to his
business and his church work.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet as a citizen he has always taken a most
positive course in opposition to the evils that
threaten society. He has been forever
prompted by his religious convictions to pursue
vice either in the “dive,” or in municipal, state
or national life. He hates a barroom, but he
hates a treasury looter far more fiercely. His
idea of Christian duty was evidently derived
from the scene wherein the Master took a
scourge and drove the corrupt traders and
office-holders out of the temple. It is vigorous,
it is militant; but it makes enemies. Consequently,
Mr. Wanamaker is not without persistent
maligners; getting himself well hated by
the worst men in the community.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>INVEST IN YOURSELF</h3>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Wanamaker’s views of what life is for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>are well expressed in the following excerpt
from one of his addresses to young men.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the course of his address, he related that
he was once called upon to invest in
an expedition to recover Spanish mahogany
and doubloons from the Spanish Main,
which, for half a century, had lain under
the rolling waves in sunken frigates. “But,
young men,” he continued, “I know of better
expeditions than this right at home, deep
down under the sea of neglect and ignorance
and discouragement. Near your own feet lie
treasures untold, and you can have them all
for your own by earnest watch and faithful
study and proper care.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us not be content to mine the most coal,
make the largest locomotives and weave the
largest quantities of carpets; but, amid the
sounds of the pick, the blows of the hammer,
the rattle of the looms, and the roar of the machinery,
take care that the immortal mechanism
of God’s own hand,—the mind,—is still
full-trained for the highest and noblest service.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is the most enduring kind of property
to acquire, a property of soul which no disaster
can wreck or ruin. Whatever may be the
changes that shall sweep over our fair land, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>power can ever take away from you your investments
in knowledge.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AT HOME</h3>

<p class='c016'>Like all other magnetic and forceful men,
Mr. Wanamaker is striking in appearance,
strong rather than handsome. He has a full,
round head, a broad forehead, a strong nose,
heavy-lidded eyes that flash with energy, heavy
jaws that denote strength of will, and tightly
closed lips that just droop at the corners, giving
an ever-present touch of sedateness. His face
is as smooth as a boy’s and as mobile as an
actor’s; and, when lighted up in discussion, it
beams with expression. He wears a hat that
is only six and seven-eighths in size, but is almost
completely circular in form. He is almost
six feet tall and finely built, and all his
motions have in them the springiness of health.
Nobody ever saw him dressed in any other
color than black, with a black necktie under
a “turn-down” collar. But he always looks
as trim as if he were just out of the hands of
both tailor and barber.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is his delight to pass much time at his
country seat in Jenkintown. He is fond of the
field and the river, the trees and flowers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>all the growths with which God has beautified
the earth. His house is a home-like structure,
with wide piazzas, standing upon the crest of a
hill in the midst of a noble lawn. A big rosery
and orchid house stand near by. The before-breakfast
ramble of the proprietor is finished
in the flower garden, and every guest is laden
with floral trophies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Wanamaker was married, while he was
the Secretary of the Y. M. C. A., to one whom
he met at a church service, and who has been in
full sympathy with his religious activities. He
has been for forty years superintendent of the
Bethany Sunday School in Philadelphia. He
began with two teachers and twenty-seven
pupils; and at the recent anniversary reported
a school of 4,500, a church with 3,700 members,
500 having been added during the past year,
several branches, and scores of department organizations.</p>

<p class='c011'>John Wanamaker says to-day that his business
success is due to his religious training.
He is first of all a Christian.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lesson of such a life should be precious
to every young man. It teaches the value of
untiring effort, of economy, of common sense
applied to common business. I know of no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>career in this country that offers more encouragement
to young people. It shows what persistency
can do; it shows what intelligent, well-directed,
tireless effort can do; and it proves
that a man may devote himself to helping
others, to the Sunday School, to the Church, to
broad philanthropy, and still be wonderfully
successful in a business way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Giving up Five Thousand Dollars a Year to Become a Sculptor</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>“MY life?” queried F. Wellington
Ruckstuhl, one of the foremost
sculptors of America, as we sat in
his studio looking up at his huge figure of
“Force.” “When did I begin to sculpture?
As a child I was forever whittling, but I did
not have dreams then of becoming a sculptor.
It was not till I was thirty-two years of age.
And love,—disappointment in my first love
played a prominent part.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But as a boy, Mr. Ruckstuhl?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was a poet. Every sculptor or artist is
necessarily a poet. I was always reaching out
and seeking the beautiful. My father was a
foreman in a St. Louis machine shop. He
came to this country in a sailing ship from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Alsace, by way of the Gulf to St. Louis, when
I was but six years old. He was a very pious
man and a deacon in a church. One time,
Moody and Sankey came to town, and my
father made me attend the meetings; I think
he hoped that I would become a minister. Between
the ages of fourteen and nineteen, I
worked in a photographic supply store; wrote
one hundred poems, and read incessantly. I
enlarged a view of the statue of Nelson in
Trafalgar Square, London, into a ‘plaster
sketch,’ ten times as large as the picture, but
still I did not know my path. I began the study
of philosophy, and kept up my reading for ten
years. My friends thought I would become a
literary man. I wrote for the papers, and belonged
to a prominent literary club. I tried to
analyze myself. ‘I am a man,’ I said, ‘but
what am I good for? What am I to make of
this life?’ I drifted from one position to another.
Every one was sorry to part with my
services, for I always did my duties as well as
they could be done. When I was twenty-five
years of age, the girl to whom I was attached
was forced by her mother to marry a wealthy
man. She died a year afterwards; and I
‘pulled up stakes,’ and started on a hap-hazard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>reckless career. I went to Colorado, drifted
into Arizona, prospected, mined, and worked
on a ranch. I went to California, and at one
time thought of shipping for China. My experiences
would fill a book. Again I reached
St. Louis. For a year, I could not find a thing
to do, and became desperate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you had done nothing at art so far?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At that time, I saw a clay sketch. I said
to myself, ‘I can do as well as that,’ and I
copied it. My second sketch admitted me to
the St. Louis Sketch Club. I told my friends
that I would be a sculptor. They laughed
and ridiculed me. I had secured a position
in a store, and at odd times worked at
what I had always loved, but had only
half realized it. Notices appeared in the
papers about me, for I was popular in the
community. I entered the competition for a
statue of General Frank R. Blair. I received
the first prize, but when the committee discovered
that I was only a bill clerk in a store, they
argued that I was not competent to carry out
the work; although I was given the first prize
model and the one hundred and fifty dollars accompanying
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“But that inspired you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but my father and mother put every
obstacle in the way possible. I was driven
from room to room. I was not even allowed to
work in the attic.” Here Mr. Ruckstuhl
laughed. “You see what genius has to contend
with. I was advanced in position in the
store, till I became assistant manager, at two
thousand dollars a year. When I told the
proprietor that I had decided to be a sculptor,
he gazed at me in blank astonishment. ‘A
sculptor?’ he queried, incredulously, and made
a few very discouraging remarks, emphasized
with dashes. ‘Why, young man, are you
going to throw up the chance of a lifetime? I
will give you five thousand dollars a year, and
promote you to be manager if you will remain
with me.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I had found my life’s work,” said Mr.
Ruckstuhl, turning to me. “I knew it would
be a struggle through poverty, till I attained
fame. But I was confident in myself, which is
half of the battle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you went abroad?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, with but two hundred and fifty
dollars,” he replied. “I traveled through
Europe for five months and visited the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Salon. I said to myself, ‘I can do that, and
that;’ and my confidence grew. But there was
some work that completely ‘beat’ me. I returned
to America penniless, but with a greater
insight into art. I determined that I would retrace
my steps to Paris, and study there for
three years, and thought that would be sufficient
to fully develop me. My family and
friends laughed me to scorn, and I was discouraged
by everyone. In four months, in St.
Louis, I secured seven orders for busts, at two
hundred dollars each, to be done after my return
from France. That shows that some persons
had confidence in me and in my talent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O, the student life in Paris! How I look
back with pleasure upon those struggling, yet
happy days! In two months, I started on my
female figure of ‘Evening,’ in the nude, that
is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I
finished it in nine months, and positively sweat
blood in my work. I sent it to the Salon, and
went to Italy. When I returned to Paris, I
saw my name in the paper with honorable mention.
I suppose you can realize my feelings; I
experienced the first flush of victory. I brought
it to America, and exposed it in St. Louis.
Strange to say, I rose in the estimation of even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>my family. My father actually congratulated
me. A wealthy man in St. Louis gave me
three thousand dollars to have my ‘Evening’
put into marble. I returned with it to Paris,
and in a month and a quarter it was exhibited
in the Salon. At the World’s Fair, at Chicago,
it had the place of honor, and received one of
the eleven grand medals given to American
sculptors. In 1892, I came to New York.
This statue of ‘Force’ will be erected, with
my statue of ‘Wisdom,’ on the new Court of
Appeals in New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We gazed at it, seated, and clothed in partial
armor, of the old Roman type, and holding a
sword across its knees. The great muscles
spoke of strength and force, and yet, with it
all, there was an almost benign look upon the
military visage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is force and real action there withal,
although there is repose.” I said in admiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” said Mr. Ruckstuhl, “that’s it, and
that is what it is so hard to get! That is what
every sculptor strives for; and, unless he attains
it, his work, from my point of view, is
worthless. There must be life in a statue; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>must almost breathe. In repose there must be
dormant action that speaks for itself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is most of your work done under inspiration?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is nothing,—and a great deal,—in
so-called inspiration. I firmly believe that we
mortals are merely tools, mediums, at work
here on earth. I peg away, and bend all my
energies to my task. I simply accomplish
nothing. Suddenly, after considerable preparatory
toil, the mist clears away; I see things
clearly; everything is outlined for me. I believe
there is a conscious and a sub-conscious
mind. The sub-conscious mind is the one that
does original work; it cannot be affected by the
mind that is conscious to all our petty environments.
When the conscious mind is lulled and
silenced, the sub-conscious one begins to work.
That I call inspiration.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you ever discouraged?” I asked out
of curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Continually,” replied Mr. Ruckstuhl, looking
down at his hands, soiled with the working
clay. “Some days I will be satisfied with what
I have done. It will strike me as simply fine.
I will be as happy as a bird, and leave simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>joyous. The following morning, when the
cloths are removed, I look at my previous toil,
and consider it vile. I ask myself: ‘Are you
a sculptor or not? Do you think that you ever
will be one? Do you consider that art?’ So
it is, till your task is accomplished. You are
your own critic, and are continually distressed
at your inability to create your ideals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. F. Wellington Ruckstuhl is forty-six
years of age; neither short nor tall; a brilliant
man, with wonderful powers of endurance, for
his work is more exacting and tedious than is
generally supposed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have simply worked a month and a quarter
on that statue,” he said. “Certain work
dissatisfied me, and I obliterated it. I have
raised that head three times. My eyes get
weary, and I become physically tired. On such
occasions I sit down and smoke a little to distract
my thoughts, and to clear my mind.
Then my sub-conscious mind comes into play
again,” he concluded with a smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Ruckstuhl’s best known works are:
“Mercury Teasing the Eagle of Jupiter,”
which is of bronze, nine feet high, which he
made in Paris; a seven-foot statue of Solon,
erected in the Congressional Library, at Washington;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>busts of Franklin, Gœthe and Macaulay,
on the front of the same library; and
the eleven-foot statue of bronze of “Victory,”
for the Jamaica soldiers’ and sailors’ monument.
In competition, he won the contract for
an equestrian statue of General John F. Hartrauft,
ex-Governor of Pennsylvania, which he
also made in Paris. It is considered the finest
piece of work of its kind in America. Besides
this labor, he has made a number of medallions
and busts; and with the completion of his
statue of “Force,” he will have made a wonderful
record.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Art was in me as a child,” he said:   “I
was discouraged whenever it beckoned me, but
finally claimed me. I surrendered a good position
to follow it, whether it led through a
thorny road or not. A sculptor is an artist, a
musician, a poet, a writer, a dramatist,—to
throw action, breath and life, music and a soul
into his creation. I can pick up an instrument
and learn it instantly; I can sing, and act, so
I am in touch with the sympathies of the beings
that I endeavor to create. You will find most
sculptors and artists of my composite nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There,” said Mr. Ruckstuhl, and he
stretched out his arm, with his palm downward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and moved it through the air, as he
gazed into distance, “you strive to create the
imagination of your mind, and it comes to
you as if sent from another world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You strive.” That is the way to success.</p>

<p class='c013'>Questions and Answers: Business Pointers by Darius Ogden Mills</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>“WHAT is your idea, Mr. Mills,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of a
successful life?”   “If a bootblack
does all the good he possibly
can for his fellow-men, his life has been
just as successful as that of the millionaire
who helps thousands.”</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f2'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Mills was born in Western New York in 1825.
He has been a leading financier for fifty years, in California,
and in New York. He is connected with the
management of eighteen important business and philanthropic
corporations in New York City.</p>
</div>
<h3 class='c015'>WORK</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What, Mr. Mills, do you consider the key-note
of success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Work,” he replied, quickly and emphatically.
“Work develops all the good there is in
a man; idleness all the evil. Work sharpens all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>his faculties and makes him thrifty; idleness
makes him lazy and a spendthrift. Work surrounds
a man with those whose habits are industrious
and honest; in such society a weak
man develops strength, and a strong man is
made stronger. Idleness, on the other hand, is
apt to throw a man into the company of men
whose object in life is usually the pursuit of unwholesome
and demoralizing diversions.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SELF-DEPENDENCE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“To what formative influence do you attribute
your material success, Mr. Mills?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was taught very early that I would have
to depend entirely upon myself; that my future
lay in my own hands. I had that for a start,
and it was a good one. I didn’t waste any
time thinking about succession to wealth, which
so often acts as a drag upon young men. Many
persons waste the best years of their lives waiting
for dead men’s shoes; and, when they get
them, find them entirely too big to wear gracefully,
simply because they have not developed
themselves to wear them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As a rule, the small inheritance, which, to
a boy, would seem large, has a tendency to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>lessen his efforts, and is a great damage to him
in the way of acquiring the habits necessary
to success.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HABIT OF THRIFT</h3>

<p class='c016'>“No one can acquire a fortune unless he
makes a start; and the habit of thrift, which he
learns in saving his first hundred dollars, is of
inestimable value later on. It is not the money,
but the habit which counts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no one so helpless as a man who
is ‘broke,’ no matter how capable he may be,
and there is no habit so detrimental to his reputation
among business men as that of borrowing
small sums of money. This cannot be too
emphatically impressed upon young men.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>EXPENSIVE HABITS—SMOKING</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Another thing is that none but the
wealthy, and very few of them, can afford the
indulgence of expensive habits; how much less
then can a man with only a few dollars in his
pocket? More young men are ruined by the
expense of smoking than in any other way.
The money thus laid out would make them independent,
in many cases, or at least would
give them a good start. A young man should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>be warned by the melancholy example of those
who have been ruined by smoke, and avoid it.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>FORMING AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS JUDGMENT</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What marked traits, Mr. Mills, have the
influential men with whom you have been associated,
possessed, which most impressed you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A habit of thinking and acting for themselves.
No end of people are ruined by taking
the advice of others. This may answer temporarily,
but in the long run it is sure to be disastrous.
Any man who hasn’t ability to judge
for himself would better get a comfortable
clerkship somewhere, letting some one of more
ambition and ability do the thinking necessary
to run the business.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MULTIPLICATION OF OPPORTUNITIES TO-DAY IN AMERICA</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Are the opportunities for making money
as numerous to-day as they were when you
started in business?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the progress of science and invention
has increased the opportunities a thousandfold,
and a man can find them wherever he seeks
them in the United States in particular. It has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>caused the field of employment of labor of all
kinds to expand enormously, thus creating opportunities
which never existed before. It is
no longer necessary for a man to go to foreign
countries or distant parts of his own country
to make money. Opportunities come to him
in every quarter. There is hardly a point in
the country so obscure that it has not felt the
revolutionizing influence of commercial enterprise.
Probably railroads and electricity are
the chief instruments in this respect. Other industries
follow closely in their wake.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>WHERE ONE’S BEST CHANCE IS—THE KNOWLEDGE OF MEN</h3>

<p class='c016'>“In what part of the country do you think
the best chances for young men may be
found?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The best place for a young man to make
money is the town in which he was born and
educated. There he learns all about everybody,
and everybody learns about him. This is to
his advantage if he bears a good character, and
to the advantage of his towns-people if he bears
a bad one. While a young man is growing up,
he unconsciously absorbs a vast deal of knowledge
of people and affairs, which would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>equal to money if he only has the judgment to
avail himself of it. A knowledge of men is the
prime secret of business success. Upon reflection,
how absurd it is for a man to leave a town
where he knows everything and everybody, and
go to some distant point where he doesn’t know
anything about anybody or anything, and expect
to begin on an equal footing with the people
there who are thoroughly acquainted.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What lesson, Mr. Mills, do you consider
it most needful for young men to learn?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The lesson of humility;—not in the sense
of being servile or undignified, but in that of
paying due respect to men who are their superiors
in the way of experience, knowledge
and position. Such a lesson is akin to that of
discipline. Members of the royal families of
Europe are put in subordinate positions in the
navies or armies of their respective countries,
in order that they may receive the training
necessary to qualify them to take command.
They must first know how to obey, if they
would control others.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In this country, it is customary for the
sons of the presidents of great railroads, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>other companies, to begin at the bottom of the
ladder and work their way up step by step, just
the same as any other boy in the employ of the
corporation. This course has become imperatively
necessary in the United States, where each
great business has become a profession in itself.
Most of the big machine shops number among
their employees, scions of old families who
carry dinner pails, and work with files or lathes,
the same as anyone else. Such shoulder-to-shoulder
experience is invaluable to a man who
is destined to command, because he not only
masters the trade technically, but learns all
about the men he works with and qualifies himself
to grapple with labor questions which may
arise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no end of conspicuous examples
of the wisdom of this system in America. There
are also many instances of disaster to great industrial
concerns due to the inexperience or the
lack of tact of men placed suddenly in control.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE BENEFICENT USE OF CAPITAL</h3>

<p class='c016'>Upon this point, Mr. Mills said:—“A man
can, in the accumulation of a fortune, be just as
great a benefactor of mankind as in the distribution
of it. In organizing a great industry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>one opens up fields of employment for a multitude
of people who might otherwise be practically
helpless, giving them not only a chance
to earn a living for themselves and their families,
but also to lay by a competency for old
age. All honest, sober men, if they have half a
chance, can do that; but only a small percentage
can ever become rich. Now the rich man, having
acquired his wealth, knows better how to
manage it than those under him would, and
having actual possession, he has the power to
hold the community of his employees and their
interests together, and prevent disintegration,
which means disaster so much oftener to the
employee than to the employer.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE OF EARNING AND SPENDING</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What is the responsibility of wealth, Mr.
Mills?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A man must learn not to think too much of
money. It should be considered as a means
and not an end; and the love for it should never
be permitted to so warp a man’s mind as to
destroy his interest in progressive ideas. Making
money is an education, and the wide experience
thus acquired teaches a man discrimination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>in both men and projects, where money
is under consideration. Very few men who
make their own money use it carelessly. Most
good projects that fail owe their failure to bad
business management, rather than to lack of intrinsic
merit. An inventor may have a very
good thing, and plenty of capital may be enlisted
but if a man not acquainted with the
peculiar line, or one who is not a good salesman
or financier be employed as manager, the
result is disastrous. A man should spend his
money in a way that tends to advance the best
interests of society in the country he lives in,
or in his own neighborhood at least. There is
only one thing that is a greater harm to the
community than a rich spendthrift, and that is
a miser.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>PERSONAL: A WORD ABOUT CHEAP HOTELS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“How did you happen to establish the system
of hotels which bears your name, Mr.
Mills?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had been looking around for several years
to find something to do that would be for the
good of the community. My mind was largely
on other matters, but it occurred to me that the
hotel project was the best, and I immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>went to work at it. My purpose was to do the
work on so large a scale that it would be appreciated
and spread all over the country; for as
the sources of education extend, we find more
and more need of assisting men who have a
disposition for decency and good citizenship.
<i>The mechanic is well paid, and the man who
has learned to labor is much more independent
than he who is prepared for a profession or a
scientific career, or other objects in life that call
for higher education.</i> Clerks commencing at
small salaries need good surroundings and
economy to give themselves a start. Such are
the men for whom the hotels were established.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>OF the internationally famous singers,
none is a greater favorite than Madame
Lillian Nordica. She has had
honors heaped upon her by every music-loving
country. Milan, St. Petersburg, Paris, London
and New York, in turn accepted her. Jewel
cases filled with bracelets, necklaces, tiaras and
diadems, of gold and precious stones, attest the
unaffected sincerity of her admirers in all the
great music-centers of the world. She enjoys,
in addition, the distinction of being one of the
first two American women to attain to international
fame as a singer in grand opera.</p>

<p class='c011'>Madame Nordica I met on appointment at
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where she kindly
detailed for me</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>THE DIFFICULTIES</h3>
</div>
<p class='c017'>she encountered at the outset:—“Distinction
in the field of art is earned: it is not thrust upon
anyone. The material for a great voice may
be born in a person—it is, in fact,—but the
making of it into a great voice is a work of the
most laborious character.</p>
<p class='c011'>“In some countries the atmosphere is not
very favorable to beginners. Almost any of the
greater European nations is probably better in
this respect than the United States: not much
better, however, because nearly all depends
upon strength of character, determination, and
the will to work. If a girl has these, she will
rise as high, in the end, anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Madame Nordica came of New England
stock, being born at Farmington, Maine, and
reared in Boston. Her parents, bearing the
name Norton, possessed no musical talent.
“Their opinion of music,” said Madame, “was
that it is an airy, inviting art of the devil, used
to tempt men’s feet to stray from the solemn
path of right. They believed music, as a vocation,
to be nearly as reprehensible as a stage
career, and for the latter they had no tolerance
whatever. I must be just, though, and own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>that they did make an exception in the case of
church music, else I should never have received
the slightest encouragement in my aspirations.
They considered music in churches to be permissible,—even
laudable, so when I displayed
some ability as a singer, I was allowed to use
it in behalf of religion, and I did. I joined the
church choir and sang hymns about the house
almost constantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I needed a world of training. I
had no conception of what work lay ahead of
anyone who contemplates singing perfectly. I
had no idea of how high I might go myself. All
I knew was that I could sing, and that I would
win my way with my voice if I could.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you accomplish it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By devoting all my time, all my thought,
and all my energy to that one object. I devoured
church music,—all I could get hold of. I practised
new and difficult compositions all the time
I could spare.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I became a very good church singer; so
much so that when there were church concerts
or important religious ceremonies, I was always
in demand. Then there began to be a
social demand for my ability, and, later, a public
demand in the way of concerts.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“At first, I ignored all but church singing.
My ambition ran higher than concert singing,
and I knew my parents would not consent. I
persuaded them to let me have my voice trained.
This was not very difficult, because my church
singing, as it had improved, became a source
of considerable profit; and they saw even
greater results for me in the large churches, and
in the religious field. So I went to a teacher of
vocal culture, Professor John O’Neill, one of
the instructors in the New England Conservatory
of Music, Boston. He was a fine old
teacher, a man with the highest ideals concerning
music, and of the sternest and most exacting
method. He made me feel, at first, that</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE WORLD WAS MINE, IF I WOULD WORK.</h3>
<p class='c017'>Hard work was his constant cry. There must
be no play, no training for lower forms of public
entertainment, no anything but study and
practice. I must work and perfect myself in
private, and then suddenly appear unheralded
in the highest class of opera and take the world
by storm.</p>
<p class='c011'>“It was a fine fancy, but it would not have
been possible. O’Neill was a fine musician. Under
him I studied the physiology of the voice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and practiced singing oratorios. I also took up
Italian, familiarizing myself with the language,
with all the songs and endless <i>arias</i>. In fact, I
made myself as perfect in Italian as possible. In
<i>three years</i> I had been greatly improved. Mr.
O’Neill, however, employed methods of making
me work which discouraged me. He was
a man who would magnify and storm over the
slightest error, and make light of or ignore the
sincerest achievements. He put his grade of
perfection so high that I began to consider it
unattainable, and lost heart. Finally, I gave
it up and rested awhile, uncertain of everything.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After I had thought awhile and regained
some confidence, I came to New York to see
Mme. Maretzek. She was not only a teacher,
but also a singer quite famous in her day, and
she thoroughly knew the world of music. She
considered my voice to be of the right quality
for the highest grade of operatic success;
and gave me hope that, with a little more training,
I could begin my career. She not only
did that, but also set me to studying the great
operas, ‘Lucia’ and the others, and introduced
me to the American musical celebrities.
Together we heard whatever was worth hearing
in New York.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“When the renowned Brignola came to New
York, she took me to the Everett House, where
he was stopping and introduced me. They
were good friends, and, after gaining his opinion
on the character of my voice, she had him
play ‘Faust.’ That was a wonderful thing for
me. To hear the great Brignola! It fired my
ambition. As I listened I felt that I could also
be great and that people, some day, might listen
to me as enraptured as I then was by him.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“IT PUT NEW FIRE INTO ME</h3>
<p class='c017'>and caused me to fairly toil over my studies. I
would have given up all my hours if only I had
been allowed or requested.</p>
<p class='c011'>“So it went, until <i>after several years of
study</i>, Madame Maretzek thought I was getting
pretty well along and might venture some
important public singing. We talked about different
ways of appearing and what I would
sing, and so on, until finally Gilmore’s band
came to Madison Square Garden. He was in
the heyday of his success then, and carried important
soloists with him. Madame Maretzek
decided that she would take me to see him and
get his opinion; and so, one day, toward the
very last of his Madison Square engagement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>we went to see him. Madame Maretzek was
on good terms with him also. I remember that
she took me in, one morning, when he was rehearsing.
I saw a stout, kindly, genial-looking
man who was engaged in tapping for attention,
calling certain individuals to notice certain
points, and generally fluttering around over a
dozen odds and ends. Madame Maretzek
talked with him a little while and then called
his attention to me. He looked toward me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Thinks she can sing, eh? Yes, yes. Well,
all right! Let her come right along.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he called to me,—‘Come right along
now. Step right up here on the stage. Yes, yes.
Now, what can you sing?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told him I could sing almost anything in
oratorio or opera, if he so wished. He said:
‘Well, well, have a little from both. Now,
what shall it be?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall never forget his kindly way. He
was like a good father, gentle and reassuring,
and seemed really pleased to have me there and
to hear me. I went up on the platform and told
him that I would begin with ‘Let the Bright
Seraphim,’ and he called the orchestra to order
and had them accompany me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was slightly nervous at first, but recovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>my equanimity and sang up to my full
limit of power. When I was through, he remarked,
‘Very good! very good!’ and ‘Now,
what else?’ I next sang an <i>aria</i> from ‘Somnambula.’
He did not hesitate to express his
approval, which was always, ‘Very good! very
good! Now, what you want to do,’ he said, ‘is
to get some roses in your cheeks, and come
along and sing for me.’ After that, he continued
his conference with Madame Maretzek
and then we went away together.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“I WAS TRAVELING ON AIR</h3>
<p class='c017'>when I left, I can assure you. His company
was famous. Its engagement had been most
successful. Madame Poppenheim was singing
with it, and there were other famous names.
There were only two more concerts to conclude
his New York engagement, but he had told
Madame Maretzek that if I chose to come and
sing on these occasions, he would be glad to
have me. I was more than glad of the opportunity
and agreed to go. We arranged with
him by letter, and, when the evening came, I
sang. My work made a distinct impression on
the audience, and pleased Mr. Gilmore wonderfully.
After the second night, when all was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>over, he came to me, and said: ‘Now, my
dear, of course there is no more concert this
summer, but I am going West in the fall. Now,
how would you like to go along?’</p>
<p class='c011'>“I told him that I would like to go very
much, if it could be arranged; and, after some
negotiation, he agreed to pay the expenses of
my mother and myself, and give me one hundred
dollars a week besides. I accepted, and
when the western tour began, we went along.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I gained thorough control of my nerves
upon that tour, and learned something of audiences,
and of what constitutes distinguished
‘stage presence.’ <i>I studied all the time</i>, and,
with the broadening influence of travel, gained
a great deal. At the end of the tour, my voice
was more under my control than ever before,
and I was a better singer all around.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You did not begin with grand opera, after
all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I did not. It was not a perfect conclusion
of my dreams, but it was a great deal.
My old instructor, Mr. O’Neill, took it worse
than I did. He regarded my ambitions as having
all come to naught. I remember that he
wrote me a letter in which he thus called me to
account:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“‘After all my training, my advice, that you
should come to this! A whole lifetime of ambition
and years of the hardest study consumed
to fit you to go on the road with a brass band!
Poh!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I pocketed the sarcasm in the best of humor,
because I was sure of my dear old teacher’s
unwavering faith in me, and knew that he
wrote only for my own good. Still, I felt that
I was doing wisely in getting before the public,
and so decided to wait quietly and see if time
would not justify me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the season was over, Mr. Gilmore
came to me again. He was the most kindly
man I ever knew. His manner was as gentle
and his heart as good as could be.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I am going to Europe,’ he said. ‘I am going
to London and Paris and Vienna and
Rome, and all the other big cities. There will
be a fine chance for you to see all those places
and let Europeans hear you. They appreciate
good singers. Now, little girl, do you want to
come? If you do, you can.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I talked it over with my mother and Madame
Maretzek, and decided to go; and so, the
next season, we were</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>IN EUROPE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“We gave seventy-eight concerts in England
and France. We opened the Trocadero at
Paris, and mine was the first voice of any kind
to sing there. This European tour of the
American band was a great and successful venture.
American musicians still recall the <i>furore</i>
which it created, and the prestige which it
gained at home. Mr. Gilmore was proud of his
leading soloists. In Paris, where the great audiences
went wild over my singing, he came to
praise me personally in unmeasured terms. ‘My
dear,’ he said, ‘you are going to be a great
singer. You are going to be crowned in your
own country yet. Mark my words: they are
going to put diamonds on your brow!’ [Madame
Nordica had good occasion to recall this,
in 1898, many years after, when her enthusiastic
New York admirers crowned her with a
diamond tiara as a tribute of their admiration
and appreciation.]</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was at the time when Gilmore was at
the height of his Paris engagement that his
agent ran off with his funds and left the old
bandmaster almost stranded. Despite his sincere
trouble, he retained his imperturbable good
nature, and came out of it successfully. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>came to me, one morning, smiling good-naturedly,
as usual. After greeting me and inquiring
after my health, he said:   ‘My dear
child, you have saved some little money on this
tour?’ I told him I had.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Now, I would like to borrow that little
from you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was very much surprised at the request,
for he said nothing whatever of his loss. Still,
he had been so uniformly kind and generous,
and had won our confidence and regard so
wholly, that I could not hesitate. I turned over
nearly all I had, and he gathered it up and went
away, simply thanking me. Of course, I heard
of the defalcation later. It became generally
known. Our salaries went right on, however,
and in a few months the whole thing
had been quite forgotten, when he came to me
one morning with money ready in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘To pay you what I owe you, my dear,’ he
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Oh, yes!’ I said; ‘so and so much,’—naming
the amount.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Here it is,’ he said; and, handing me a roll
of bills, he went away. Of course, I did not
count it until a little later; but, when I did, I
found just double the amount I had named,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and no persuasion would ever induce him to
accept a penny of it back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When did you part with Gilmore?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the end of that tour. He determined to
return to America, and I had decided to spend
some of my earnings on further study in Italy.
Accordingly, I went to Milan, to the singing
teacher San Giovanni. On arriving there, I
visited the old teacher and stated my object. I
said that I wanted to sing in grand opera.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“‘WHY DON’T YOU SING IN GRAND OPERA?’</h3>

<p class='c016'>“He answered; ‘let me hear your voice.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I sang an <i>aria</i> from ‘Lucia’; and, when I
was through, he said, dryly: ‘You want to
sing in grand opera?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Well, why don’t you?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I need training.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Nonsense!’ he answered. ‘We will attend
to that. You need a few months to practice
Italian methods,—that is all.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I spent three months with him. After
much preparation, I made my <i>début</i> as Violetta
in Verdi’s opera, ‘La Traviata,’ at the Teatro
Grande, in Brescia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The details of Madame Nordica’s Italian appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>are very interesting. Her success was
instantaneous. Her fame went up and down
the land, and across the water—to her home.
She next sang in Gounod’s “Faust,” at Geneva,
and soon afterwards appeared at Navarro,
singing Alice in Meyerbeer’s “Roberto,” the
enthusiastic and delighted subscribers presenting
her with a handsome set of rubies and
pearls. After that, she was engaged to sing
at the Russian capital, and accordingly went to
St. Petersburg, where, in October, 1881, she
made her <i>début</i> as La Filina in “Mignon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There, also her success was great. She was
the favorite of the society of the court, and received
pleasant attentions from every quarter.
Presents were made her, and inducements for
her continued presence until two winters had
passed. Then she decided to revisit France and
Paris.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THIS WAS HER CROWNING TRIUMPH</h3>

<p class='c016'>“I wanted to sing in grand opera at Paris,”
she said to me. “I wanted to know that I could
appear successfully in that grand place. I
counted my achievements nothing until I could
do that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And did you?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Yes. In July, 1882, I appeared there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was her greatest triumph. In the part
of Marguerite, she took the house by storm,
and won from the composer the highest encomiums.
Subsequently, she appeared with equal
success as Ophélie, having been specially prepared
for both these rôles by the respective
composers, Charles Gounod and Ambroise
Thomas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You should have been satisfied, after that,”
I said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was,” she answered. “So thoroughly
was I satisfied that soon afterwards I gave up
my career, and was married. For two years, I
remained away from the public; but after that
time, my husband having died, I decided to
return.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I made my first appearance at the Burton
Theatre in London, and was doing well enough
when Colonel Mapleson came to me. He was
going to produce grand opera,—in fact he was
going to open Covent Garden, which had been
closed for a long time, with a big company. He
was another interesting character. I found him
to be generous and kind-hearted and happy-spirited
as anyone could be. When he came to
me, it was in the most friendly manner. ‘I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>going to open Covent Garden.’ he said. ‘Now,
here is your chance to sing there. All the great
singers have appeared there. Patti, Gerster,
Nilsson, Tietjens; now it’s your turn,—come
and sing.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘How about terms?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Terms!’ he exclaimed; ‘terms! Don’t
let such little details stand in your way. What
is money compared to this? Ignore money.
Think of the honor, of the memories of the
place, of what people think of it.’ And then he
waved his arms dramatically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet, we came to terms, not wholly sacrificial
on my part, and the season began. Covent
Garden had not been open for a long time. It
was in the spring of the year, cold and damp.
There was a crowded house, though, because
fashion accompanied the Prince of Wales there.
He came, night after night, and heard the opera
through with an overcoat on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was no pleasant task for me, or healthy,
either, but the Lord has blessed me with a
sound constitution. I sang my parts, as they
should be sung—some in bare arms and shoulders,
with too little clothing for such a temperature.
I nearly froze, but it was Covent Garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>and a great London audience, and so I bore up
under it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Things went on this way very successfully
until Sir Augustus Harris took Drury Lane
and decided to produce grand opera. He started
in opposition to Colonel Mapleson, and so Covent
Garden had to be given up. Mr. Harris
had more money, more prestige with society,
and Colonel Mapleson could not live under the
division of patronage. When I saw the situation,
I called on the new manager and talked
with him concerning the next season. He was
very proud and very condescending, and made
sure to show his indifference to me. He told
me all about the brilliant season he was planning,
gave me a list of the great names he intended
to charm with, and wound up by saying
he would call on me, in case of need, but
thought he had all the celebrities he could use,
but would let me know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, I did not like that; but I knew
I could rest awhile, and so was not much disturbed.
The time for the opening of the season
arrived. The papers were full of accounts
of the occasion, and there were plenty of remarks
concerning my non-appearance. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>‘Aida’ was produced, and I read the criticisms
of it with interest.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SHE WAS INDISPENSABLE IN “AIDA”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“The same afternoon a message came for
me: ‘Would I come?’ and ‘Would I do so and
so?’ I would, and did. I sang ‘Aida’ and then
other parts, and gradually all the parts but one,
which I had longed to try, but had not
yet had the opportunity given to me. I was
very successful, and Sir Augustus was very
friendly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The summer after that season, I visited
Ems, where the De Reszkes were. One day
they said: ‘We are going to Beirut, to hear
the music,—don’t you want to go along?’ I
thought it over, and decided that I did. My
mother and I packed up and departed. When I
got there and saw those splendid performances,
I was entranced. It was perfectly beautiful.
Everything was arranged after an ideal fashion.
I had a great desire to sing there, and
boasted to my mother that I would. When I
came away, I was fully determined to carry it
out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could you speak German?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all. I began, though, at once, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>study it; and, when I could talk it sufficiently,
I went to Beirut and saw Madame Wagner.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE KINDNESS OF FRAU WAGNER</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Did you find her the imperious old lady she
is said to be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all. She welcomed me most heartily;
and, when I told her that I had come to see if
I could not sing there, she seemed much
pleased. She treated me like a daughter, explained
all that she was trying to do, and gave
me a world of encouragement. Finally, I arranged
to sing and create ‘Elsa’ after my own
idea of it, during the season following the one
then approaching.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Meanwhile I came to New York to fulfill
my contract for the season of 1894-1895.
While doing that, I made a study of Wagner’s,
and, indeed, of all German music; and, when
the season was over, went back and sang it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Madame Nordica has found her work very
exacting. For it she has needed a good physique;
her manner of study sometimes calling
for an extraordinary mental strain:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remember once, during my season under
Augustus Harris, that he gave a garden party,
one Sunday, to which several of his company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>were invited,—myself included. When the
afternoon was well along, he came to me and
said: ‘Did you ever sing “Valencia” in “The
Huguenots?”’ I told him I had not.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Do you think you could learn the music
and sing it by next Saturday night?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I felt a little appalled at the question, but
ventured to say that I could. I knew that hard
work would do it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Then do,’ he replied; ‘for I must have
you sing it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The De Reszkes, Jean and Edouard, were
near at the time, and offered to assist me. ‘Try
it,’ they said, and so I agreed. We began rehearsals,
almost without study, the very next
day, both the De Reszkes prompting me, and
by Friday they had me letter-perfect and ready
to go on. Since the time seemed so peculiarly
short, they feared for me, and, during the performance,
stationed themselves, one in either
wing, to reassure me. Whenever I approached
near to either side of the stage, it was always to
hear their repeated ‘Be calm!’ whispered so
loud that the audience could almost hear it. Yet
I sang easily, never thinking of failure.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>MUSICAL TALENT OF AMERICAN GIRLS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Let me ask you one thing,” I said. “Has
America good musical material?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As much as any other country, and more,
I should think. The higher average of intelligence
here should yield a greater percentage of
musical intelligence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then there ought to be a number of American
women who can do good work of a high
order?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There ought to be, but it is a question
whether there will be. They are not cut out
for the work which it requires to develop a
good voice. I have noticed that young women
seem to <i>underestimate the cost of distinction</i>.
It means more than most of them are prepared
to give; and, when they face the exactions of
art, they falter and drop out. Hence we have
many middle-class singers, but few really powerful
ones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are these exactions you speak of?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Time, money, and loss of friends, of pleasure.
To be a great singer means, first, to be a
great student. To be a great student means
that you have no time for balls and parties, very
little for friends, and less for carriage rides and</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span><i>pleasant strolls. All that is really left is a
shortened allowance of sleep, of time for meals,
and time for exercise.</i>”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE PRICE OF FAME</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Permanent recognition, which cannot be
taken away from you, is acquired only by <i>a
lifetime of most earnest labor</i>. People are
never internationally recognized until they have
reached middle life. Many persons gain notoriety
young, but that goes as quickly as it
comes. <i>All true success is founded on real accomplishment
acquired with difficulty.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>“Many young people have genius; but they
need training for valuable service. The world
gives very little recognition for a great deal of
labor paid in; and, when I earn a thousand
dollars for a half hour’s singing sometimes, it
does not nearly average up for all the years and
for the labor much more difficult which I contributed
without recompense.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>How William Dean Howells Worked to Secure a Foothold</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>IN answer to my question, what constitutes
success in life, Mr. Howells replied that
everything is open to the beginner who
has sufficient energy, perseverance and brains.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A young man stands at the parting of two
ways,” he added, “and can take his path this
way or that. It is comparatively easy then,
with good judgment. Youth is certainly the
greatest advantage which life supplies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon my inquiring about his early life, he
replied:   “I was born in a little southeastern
Ohio village—Martin’s Ferry,—which had
little of what people deem advantages in
schools, railroads, or population. I am not
sure, however, that compensation was not had
in other things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As to any special talent for literary composition,
Mr. Howells remarked that he came of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>reading race, which had always loved literature
in a way, and that it was his inclination
to read.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon this, I ventured to ask: “Would you
say that, with a leaning toward a special study,
and good health, a fair start, and perseverance,
anyone can attain to distinction?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is a probability, only. You may be
sure that distinction will not come without
those qualities. The only way to succeed, is to
have them; although having them will not
necessarily guarantee distinction. I can only
say that I began with</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A LOFTY IDEAL.</h3>

<p class='c016'>“My own youth was not specially marked
by advantages. There were none, unless you
can call a small bookcase full of books, which
my home contained, an advantage. The printing-office
was my school from a very early date.
My father thoroughly believed in it, and he
had his belief as to work, which he illustrated
as soon as we were old enough to learn the
trade he followed. We could go to school and
study, or we could go into the printing-office
and work, with perhaps an equal chance of
learning; but we could not be idle.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“And you chose the printing-office?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not wholly. As I recall it, I went to and
fro between the schoolhouse and the printing-office.
When I tired of one, I was promptly
given the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As the world goes now, we were poor.
My father’s income was never above twelve
hundred a year, and his family was large; but
nobody was rich then. We lived in the simple
fashion of that time and place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My reading, somehow, went on pretty constantly.
No doubt my love for it won me a
chance to devote time to it. The length varied
with varying times.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sometimes I read but little. There were
so many years of work—of over-work, indeed,
which falls to the lot of many,—that I should
be ashamed to speak of it except in accounting
for the fact of my little reading. My father
had sold his paper in Hamilton, and bought
an interest in another at Dayton, and at that
time we were all straining our utmost to help
pay for it. In that period very few hours were
given to literature. My daily tasks began so
early, and ended so late, that I had little time,
even if I had the spirit for reading. Sometimes
I had to sit up until midnight, waiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>for telegraphic news, and be up again at dawn
to deliver the papers, working afterwards at
the case; but that was only for a few years.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>ACQUIRING A LITERARY STYLE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“When did you find time to seriously apply
yourself to literature?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I did so before I really had the
time. Literary aspirations were stirred in me
by the great authors whom I successively discovered,
and I was perpetually imitating the
writings of these,—modeling some composition
of my own after theirs, but never willing to
own it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you attribute your style to the composite
influence of these various models?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt they had their effect, as a whole,
but individually I was freed from the last by
each succeeding author, until at length I came
to understand that I must be like myself, and
no other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had you any conveniences for literary research,
beyond the bookcase in your home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you mean a place to work, I had a narrow,
little space, under the stairs. There was
a desk pushed back against the wall, which the
irregular ceiling sloped down to meet, behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>it; and at my left was a window, which gave
a good light on the writing leaf of my desk.
This was</p>
<h3 class='c015'>MY WORKSHOP</h3>
<p class='c017'>for six or seven years,—and it was not at all
a bad one. It seemed, for a while, so very
simple and easy to come home in the middle
of the afternoon, when my task at the printing-office
was done, and sit down to my books in
my little study, which I did not finally leave
until the family were all in bed. My father
had a decided bent for literature; and, when I
began to show a liking for it, he was eager to
direct my choice. This finally changed to
merely recommending books, and eventually I
was left to my own judgment,—a perplexed
and sorrowfully mistaken judgment, at times.”</p>
<p class='c011'>“In what manner did you manage to read
the works of all your favorite authors?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My hours in the printing-office began at
seven and ended at six, with an hour at noon
for dinner, which I used for putting down such
verses as had come to me in the morning. As
soon as supper was over I got out my manuscripts,
and sawed, and filed, and hammered
away at my blessed poems, which were little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>less than imitations, until nine, when I went
regularly to bed, to rise again at five. Sometimes
the foreman gave me an afternoon off on
Saturday, which I devoted to literature.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As I questioned further, it was said:   “As
I recall it, my father had secured one of those
legislative clerkships in 1858, which used to
fall sometimes to deserving country editors;
and together we managed and carried out a
scheme for corresponding with some city
papers. Going to Columbus, the State Capital,
we furnished a daily letter giving an account
of the legislative proceedings, which I mainly
wrote from the material he helped me to gather.
The letters found favor, and my father withdrew
from the work wholly. These letters I
furnished during two years.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the end of the first winter, a Cincinnati
paper offered me the city editorship, but one
night’s round with the reporters at the police
station satisfied me that I was not meant for
that kind of work. I then returned home for
the summer, and spent my time in reading,
<i>and in sending off poems, which regularly came
back</i>. I worked in my father’s printing-office;
but, as soon as my task was done, went home
to my books, and worked away at them until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>supper. Then a German bookbinder, with
whom I was endeavoring to read Heine in the
original, met me in my father’s editorial room,
and with a couple of candles on the table between
us, and our Heine and the dictionary
before us, we read until we were both tired
out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the influence of this constant writing
and constant study, Mr. Howells remarked:
“It was not without its immediate use. I
learned</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HOW TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WORDS,</h3>
<p class='c017'>after a study of their fitness; and, though I
often employed them decoratively, and with no
vital sense of their qualities, still, in mere decoration,
they had to be chosen intelligently, and
after some thought about their structure and
meaning. I could not imitate great writers
without imitating their method, which was to
the last degree intelligent. They knew what
they were doing, and, although I did not always
know what I was doing, they made me
wish to know, and ashamed of not knowing.
The result was beneficial.”</p>
<p class='c011'>Mr. Howells then spoke of his astonishment,
when one day he was at work as usual in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>printing-office at home, upon being invited to
take a place upon a Republican newspaper at
Columbus, the Capital; where he was given
charge of the news department. This included
the literary notices and book reviews, to which,
at once, he gave his prime attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When did you begin to contribute to the
literature of the day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you mean, when did I begin to attempt
to contribute, I should need to fix an early date,
for I early had experience with rejected manuscripts.
One of my pieces, upon the familiar
theme of Spring, was the first thing I ever had
in print. My father offered it to the editor of
the paper I worked on in Columbus, where we
were then living, and I first knew what he had
done, when with mingled shame and pride, I
saw it in the journal. In the tumult of my
emotions, I promised myself that if I ever got
through that experience safely, I would never
suffer anything else of mine to be published;
but it was not long before I offered the editor
a poem, myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When did you publish your first story?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My next venture was a story in the Ik
Marvel manner, which it was my misfortune
to carry into print. I did not really write it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>but composed it, rather, in type, at the case.
It was not altogether imitated from Ik Marvel,
for I drew upon the easier art of Dickens, at
times, and helped myself out in places with
bold parodies of ‘Bleak House.’ It was all
very well at the beginning, but I had not
reckoned with the future sufficiently to start
with any clear ending in my mind; and, as I
went on, I began to find myself more and more
in doubt about it. My material gave out; my
incidents failed me; the characters wavered,
and threatened to perish in my hands. To
crown my misery, there grew up an impatience
with the story among its readers; and this
found its way to me one day, when I overheard
an old farmer, who came in for his paper, say
that he ‘did not think that story amounted to
much.’ I did not think so either, but it was
deadly to have it put into words, and how I
escaped the moral effect of the stroke I do not
know. Somehow, I managed to bring the
wretched thing to a close, and to live it slowly
down.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE FATE FOLLOWING COLLABORATION</h3>

<p class='c016'>“My next contribution to literature was
jointly with John J. Piatt, the poet, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>worked with me as a boy in the printing-office
at Columbus. We met in Columbus, where I
was then an editor, and we made our first
literary venture together in a volume entitled,
‘Poems of Two Friends.’ <i>The volume became
instantly and lastingly unknown to fame</i>;
the West waited, as it always does, to hear
what the East should say. The East said nothing,
and two-thirds of the small edition of five
hundred copies came back upon the publisher’s
hands. This did not deter me, however, from
contributing to the periodicals, which from
time to time, accepted my efforts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remained as an editor, in Columbus, until
1861, when I was appointed</p>
<h3 class='c015'>CONSUL AT VENICE.</h3>
<p class='c017'>I really wanted to go to Germany, that I might
carry forward my studies in German literature;
and I first applied for the Consulate at
Munich. The powers at Washington thought
it quite the same thing to offer me Rome, but
I found that the income of the Roman Consulate
would not give me a living, and I was
forced to decline it. Then the President’s private
secretaries, Mr. John Nicolay and Mr.
John Hay, who did not know me, except as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>young Westerner who had written poems in
the ‘Atlantic Monthly,’ asked me how I would
like Venice, promising that the salary would be
put up to $1,000 a year. It was really put up
to $1,500, and I accepted. I had four years of
nearly uninterrupted leisure at Venice.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Was it easier, when you returned from
Venice?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not at all. On my return to America, my
literary life took such form that most of my
reading was done for review. I wrote at first
a good many of the lighter criticisms in ‘The
Nation;’ and then I went to Boston, to become
assistant editor of ‘The Atlantic Monthly,’
where I wrote the literary notices for that
periodical for four or five years; then I became
editor until 1881. And I have had some sort of
close relation with magazines ever since.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Would you say that all literary success is
very difficult to achieve?” I ventured.</p>

<p class='c018'>“All that is enduring.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“It seems to me ours is an age when fame
comes quickly.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Speaking of quickly made reputations,”
said Mr. Howells, meditatively, “did you ever
hear of Alexander Smith? He was a poet who,
in the fifties, was proclaimed immortal by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>critics, and ranked with Shakespeare. I myself
read him with an ecstasy which, when I
look over his work to-day, seems ridiculous.
His poem, ‘Life-Drama,’ was heralded as an
epic, and set alongside of ‘Paradise Lost.’ I
cannot tell how we all came out of this craze,
but the reading world is very susceptible to
such lunacies. He is not the only third-rate
poet who has been thus apotheosized, before
and since. You might have envied his great
success, as I certainly did; but it was not success,
after all; and I am sure that real success
is always difficult to achieve.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>MY LITERARY EXPERIENCE</h3>

<p class='c017'>“Do you believe that success comes to those
who have a special bent or taste, which they
cultivate by hard work?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I can only answer that out of <i>my literary
experience</i>. For my own part, I believe I have
<i>never got any good from a book, that I did not
read merely because I wanted to read it</i>. I
think this may be applied to anything a person
does. The book, I know, which you read from
a sense of duty, or because for any reason you
must, is apt to yield you little. This, I think,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>is also true of everything, and the endeavor
that does one good—and lasting good,—is <i>the
endeavor one makes with pleasure</i>. Labor
done in another spirit will serve in a way, but
pleasurable labor brings, on the whole, I think,
the greatest reward.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Referring again to his early years, it was remarked:
“A definite literary ambition grew
up in me; and in the long reveries of the afternoon,
when I was distributing my case in the
printing-office, I fashioned a future of over-powering
magnificence and undying celebrity.
I should be ashamed to say what literary triumphs
I achieved in those preposterous deliriums.
But I realize now that such dreams are
nerving, and sustain one in an otherwise barren
struggle.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Were you ever tempted and willing to
abandon your object of a literary life for something
else?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I was, once. My first and only essay
aside from literature was in <i>the realm of law</i>.
It was arranged with a United States Senator
that I should study law in his office. I tried it
a month, but almost from the first day, I
yearned to return to my books. <i>I had not only</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span><i>to go back to literature, but to the printing-office,
and I gladly chose to do it,—a step I
never regretted.</i>”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AS TO A HAPPY LIFE,</h3>
<p class='c017'>it was said by Mr. Howells, at the close of our
interview:—</p>
<p class='c011'>“I have come to see life, not as the chase of
a forever-impossible personal happiness, but
as <i>a field for endeavor toward the happiness of
the whole human family</i>. There is no other
success. I know, indeed, of nothing more
subtly satisfying and cheering than a knowledge
of the real good will and appreciation of
others. Such happiness does not come with
money, nor does it flow from a fine physical
state. It cannot be bought. But it is the keenest
joy, after all; and the toiler’s truest and
best reward.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>THE richest man in the United States,
John Davidson Rockefeller, has consented
to break his rule never to talk
for publication; and he has told me the story
of his early struggles and triumphs, and given
utterance to some strikingly interesting observations
anent the same. In doing so, he was
influenced by the argument that there is something
of helpfulness, of inspiration, in the
career of every self-made man.</p>

<p class='c011'>While many such careers have been prolific of
vivid contrasts, this one is simply marvelous.
Whatever may be said by political economists
of the dangers of vast aggregations of wealth
in the hands of the few, there can be no question
of the extraordinary interest attaching to
the life story of a man who was a farm laborer
at the age of fifteen, who left school at eighteen,
because he felt it to be his duty to care for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>mother and brother, and who, at the zenith of
his business career, has endowed Chicago University
with $7,500,000 out of a fortune estimated
at over $300,000,000,—probably the
largest single fortune on earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story opens in a fertile valley in Tioga
County, New York, near the village of Richford,
where John D. Rockefeller was born on
his father’s farm in July, 1838. The parents of
the boy were church-going, conscientious, debt-abhorring
folk, who preferred the independence
of a few acres to a mortgaged domain. They
were Americans to the backbone, intelligent,
industrious people, not very poor and certainly
not very rich, for at fourteen John hired out to
neighboring farmers during the summer
months, in order to earn his way and not be
dependent upon those he loved. His father
was able to attend to the little farm himself,
and thus it happened that the youth spent several
summers away from home, toiling from
sunrise to sunset, and sharing the humble life
of the people he served.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS EARLY DREAM AND PURPOSE</h3>

<p class='c016'>Did the tired boy, peering from his attic window,
ever dream of his future?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>He said to a youthful companion of Richford,
a farmer’s boy like himself:   “I would
like to own all the land in this valley, as far as
I can see. I sometimes dream of wealth and
power. Do you think we shall ever be worth
one hundred thousand dollars, you and I? I
hope to,—some day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Who can estimate the influence such a life as
this must have had upon the future multi-millionaire?
I asked Mr. Rockefeller about this,
and found him enthusiastic over the advantages
which he had received from his rural surroundings,
and full of faith in the ability of the
country boy to surpass his city cousin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To my mind,” he said, “there is something
unfortunate in being born in a city. Most
young men raised in New York and other large
centers have not had the struggles which come
to us who were reared in the country. It is a
noticeable fact that the country men are crowding
out the city fellows who have wealthy
fathers. They are willing to do more work and
go through more for the sake of winning success
in the end. Sons of wealthy parents
haven’t a ghost of a show in competition with
the fellows who come from the country with a
determination to do something in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>The next step in the young man’s life was
his going to Cleveland, Ohio, in his sixteenth
year.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was a great change in my life,” said
he. “Going to Cleveland was my first experience
in a great city, and I shall never forget
those years. I began work there as an office-boy,
and learned a great deal about business
methods while filling that position. But what
benefited me most in going to Cleveland was
the new insight I gained as to what a great
place the world really is. I had plenty of ambition
then, and saw that, if I was to accomplish
much, I would have to work very, very
hard, indeed.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SCHOOL DAYS</h3>

<p class='c016'>He found time, during the year 1854, to attend
the sessions of the school which is now
known as the Central High School. It was a
brick edifice, surrounded by grounds which
contained a number of hickory trees. It has
long since been superseded by a larger and
handsomer building, but Andrew J. Freese, the
teacher, is still living. It is one of the proudest
recollections of this delightful old gentleman’s
life that John D. Rockefeller went to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>school with him. I visited him at his residence
in Cleveland the other day, and he said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“John was one of the best boys I had. He
was always polite, but when the other boys
threw hickory clubs at him, or attempted any
undue familiarities with him, he would stop
smiling and sail into them. Young Hanna—Marcus
A. Hanna,—who was also a pupil,
learned this, to his cost, more than once, and
so did young Jones, the present Nevada senator.
I have had several very distinguished pupils,
you see, and one of my girls is now Mrs. John
D. Rockefeller. I had Edward Wolcott, the
Colorado senator, later on. Yes, John was
about as intelligent and well-behaved a chap as
I ever had. Here is one of his essays which
you may copy, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Rockefeller, I am quite sure, will pardon
me for copying his composition at this late day,
for its tone and subject matter reflect credit
upon him:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Freedom is one of the most desirable of all
blessings. Even the smallest bird or insect loves
to be free. Take, for instance, a robin that has
always been free to fly from tree to tree, and
sing its cheerful song from day to day,—catch
it, and put it into a cage which is to it nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>less than a prison, and, although it may be there
tended with the choicest care, yet it is not content.
How eloquently does it plead, though in
silence, for liberty. From day to day it sits
mournfully upon its perch, meditating, as it
were, some way for its escape, and when at
last this is effected, how cheerfully does it wing
its way out from its gloomy prison-house to
sing undisturbed in the branches of the first
trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If even the birds of the air love freedom, is
it not natural that man, the lord of creation,
should? I reply that it is, and that it is a
violation of the laws of our country, and the
laws of our God, that man should hold his fellowman
in bondage. Yet how many thousands
there are at the present time, even in our own
country, who are bound down by cruel masters
to toil beneath the scorching sun of the South.
How can America, under such circumstances,
call herself free? Is it extending freedom by
granting to the South one of the largest divisions
of land that she possesses for the purpose
of holding slaves? It is a freedom that,
if not speedily checked, will end in the ruin
of our country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was greatly to the regret of the teacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>that John came to him one day to announce his
purpose to leave school. Mr. Freese urged him
to remain two years longer, in order that he
might complete the course, but the young man
told him he felt obliged to earn more money
than he was getting, because of his desire to
provide for his mother and brother. He had
received an offer, he said, of a place on the
freight docks as a bill clerk, and this job would
take him away from his studies.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A RAFT OF HOOP POLES</h3>

<p class='c016'>A short time afterwards, when Mr. Freese
visited his former pupil at the freight dock, he
found the young man seated on a bale of goods,
bill book and pencil in hand. Pointing to a raft
of hoop poles in the water, John told his caller
that he had purchased them from a Canadian
who had brought them across Lake Erie, expecting
to sell them. Failing in this, the owner
gladly accepted a cash offer from young Rockefeller,
who named a price below the usual market
rates. The young man explained that he
<i>had saved a little money out of his wages</i>, and
that this was his first speculation. He afterwards
told Mr. Freese that he rafted the purchase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>himself to a flour mill, and disposed of
his bargain at a profit of fifty dollars.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f3'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This hoop pole story is matched by another, related
by a friend, of Rockefeller’s later warehouse days in
Cleveland. He one day bought a lot of beans. He
bought them cheap, because they were damaged. Instead
of selling them at a slight advance, as most dealers
would have done, he spent all his spare time, for weeks,
in the attic of his warehouse, sorting over those beans.
He took out all the blackened and injured ones, and in
the end he got a fancy price for the remainder, because
they were of extra quality.</p>
</div>
<h3 class='c015'>THE ODOR OF OIL</h3>

<p class='c016'>It was Mr. Freese, too, who first got the
young man interested in oil. They were using
sperm oil in those days, at a dollar and a half
a gallon. Somebody had found natural petroleum,
thick, slimy, and foul-smelling, in the
Pennsylvania creeks, and a quantity of it had
been received in Cleveland by a next-door
neighbor of the schoolmaster. The neighbor
thought it could be utilized in some way, but
his experiments were as crude as the ill-favored
stuff itself. These consisted of boiling,
burning, and otherwise testing the oil, and the
only result was the incurring of the disfavor of
the near-by residents. The young man became
interested at once. He, too, experimented with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>the black slime, draining off the clearer portions
and touching matches to it. The flames
were sickly, yellow, and malodorous.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>There must be some way of deodorizing
this oil</i>,” said John, “<i>and I will find it</i>. There
ought to be a good sale for it for illuminating
purposes, if the good oil can be separated from
the sediment, and that awful smell gotten rid
of.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How well the young man profited by the accidental
meeting is a matter of history. But
I am digressing.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS FIRST LEDGER, AND THE ITEMS IN IT</h3>

<p class='c016'>While in Cleveland, slaving away at his
tasks, Mr. Rockefeller was training himself for
the more busy days to come. He kept a small
ledger in which he entered all his receipts and
expenditures, and I had the privilege of examining
this interesting little book, and having its
contents explained to me. It was nothing more
than a small, paper-backed memorandum book.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I looked this book up the other day,
I thought I had but the cover,” said Mr. Rockefeller,
“but, on examination, I perceived that I
had utilized the cover to write on. In those
days I was very economical, just as I am economical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>now. Economy is a virtue. I hadn’t
seen my little ledger for a long time, when I
found it among some old things. It is more
than forty-two years ago since I wrote what it
contains. I called it ‘Ledger A,’ and I wouldn’t
exchange it now for all the ledgers in New
York city and their contents. A glance through
it shows me how carefully I kept account of
my receipts and disbursements. I only wish
more young men could be induced to keep accounts
like this nowadays. It would go far
toward teaching them the value of money.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Every young man should take care of his
money. I think it is a man’s duty to make all
the money he can, keep all he can, and give
away all he can.</i> I have followed this principle
religiously all my life, as is evidenced in this
book. It tells me just what I did with my money
during my first few years in business. Between
September, 1855, and January, 1856, I received
just fifty dollars. Out of this sum I paid for
my washing and my board, and managed to
save a little besides. I find, in looking through
the book, that I gave a cent to Sunday school
every Sunday. It wasn’t much, but it was all
that I could afford to give to that particular
object. <i>What I could afford to give to the</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span><i>various religious and charitable works, I gave
regularly. It is a good habit for a young man
to get into.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>“During my second year in Cleveland, I
earned twenty-five dollars a month. I was beginning
to be a capitalist,” said Mr. Rockefeller,
“and I suppose I ought to have considered
myself a criminal for having so much
money. I paid all my own bills at this time,
and had some money to give away. I also
had the happiness of saving some. I am not
sure, but I was more independent then than
now. I couldn’t buy the most fashionable cut
of clothing, but I dressed well enough. I certainly
did not buy any clothes I couldn’t pay
for, as some young men do that I know of. I
didn’t make any obligations I could not meet,
and <i>my earnest advice is for every young man
to live within his means. One of the swiftest
‘toboggan slides’ I know of, is for a young
fellow just starting out into the world to go
into debt.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>“During the time between November, 1855,
and April, 1856, I paid out just nine dollars
and nine cents for clothing. And there is one
item that was certainly extravagant as I usually
wore mittens in the winter. This item is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>for fur gloves, two dollars and a half. In this
same period <i>I gave away five dollars and fifty-eight
cents. In one month I gave to foreign
missions, ten cents, to the mite society, fifty
cents, and twelve cents to the Five Points Mission,
in New York.</i> I wasn’t living here then,
of course, but I suppose I thought the Mission
needed money. These little contributions of
mine were not large, but they brought me into
direct contact with church work, and that has
been a benefit to me all my life. It is a mistake
for a man to think that he must be rich to help
others.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS</h3>

<p class='c016'><i>He earned and saved ten thousand dollars
before he was twenty-five years old.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>Before he attained his majority, Rockefeller
formed a partnership with another young man
named Hewett, and began a warehouse and
produce business. This was the natural outgrowth
of his freight clerkship on the docks.
<i>In five years, he had amassed about ten thousand
dollars</i> besides earning a reputation for
business capacity and probity.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>HE REMEMBERED THE OIL</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>He never forgot those experiments with the
crude oil. Discoveries became more and more
frequent in the Pennsylvania oil territory.
There was a rush of speculators to the new
land of fortune. Men owning impoverished
farms suddenly found themselves rich. Thousands
of excited men bid wildly against each
other for newly-shot wells, paying fabulous
sums occasionally for dry holes.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>KEEPING HIS HEAD</h3>

<p class='c016'>John D. Rockefeller looked the entire field
over carefully and calmly. Never for a moment
did he lose his head. His Cleveland bankers and
business friends had asked him to purchase
some wells, if he saw fit, offering to back him
up with $75,000 for his own investment [he
was worth about $10,000 at the time], and to
put in $400,000 more on his report.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The business judgment of this young man
at twenty-five was so good, that his neighbors
were willing to invest half a million dollars at
his bidding.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>He returned to Cleveland without investing
a dollar. Instead of joining the mad crowd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of producers, he sagaciously determined to begin
at the other end of the business,—the refining
of the product.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THERE WAS MORE MONEY IN A REFINERY</h3>

<p class='c016'>The use of petroleum was dangerous at that
time, on account of the highly inflammable
gases it contained. Many persons stuck to
candles and sperm oil through fear of an explosion
if they used the new illuminant. The
process of removing these superfluous gases by
refining, or distilling, as it was then called, was
in its infancy. There were few men who knew
anything about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among Rockefeller’s acquaintances in Cleveland
was one of these men. His name was
Samuel Andrews. He had worked in a distillery,
and was familiar with the process. He
believed that there was a great business to be
built up by removing the gases from the crude
oil and making it safe for household use.
Rockefeller listened to him, and became convinced
that he was right. Here was a field as
wide as the world, limited only by the production
of crude oil. It was a proposition on which
he could figure and make sure of the result. It
was just the thing Rockefeller had been looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>for. He decided to leave the production of
oil to others, and to devote his attention to preparing
it for market.</p>

<p class='c011'>Andrews was a brother commission merchant.
The two started a refinery, each closing
out his former business connection. In two
weeks it was running night and day to fill orders.
So great was the demand, and so great
was the judgment of young Rockefeller,—seeing
what no one else had seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>A second refinery had to be built at once, and
in two years their plants were turning out two
thousand barrels of refined petroleum per day.
Henry M. Flagler, already wealthy, came into
the firm, the name of which then became
Rockefeller, Flagler and Andrews. More refineries
were built, not only at Cleveland, but
also at other advantageous points. Competing
refineries were bought or rendered ineffective
by the cutting of prices.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is related that Mr. Andrews became one
day dissatisfied, and he was asked,—“What
will you take for your interest?” Andrews
wrote carelessly on a piece of paper,—“One
million dollars.” Within twenty-four hours he
was handed that amount; Mr. Rockefeller saying,—“Cheaper
at one million than ten.” In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>building up the refinery business Rockefeller
was the head; the others were the hands. He
was always the general commanding, the tactician.
He made the plans and his associates
carried them out. Here was the post for which
he had fitted himself, and in which his genius
for planning had full sway. In the conduct of
the refinery affairs, as in every enterprise in
which he has taken part, he exemplified another
rule to which he had adhered from his boyhood
days. He was the leader in whatever he undertook.
In going into any undertaking, John D.
Rockefeller has made it his rule to have the
chief authority in his own hands or to have
nothing to do with the matter.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>STANDARD OIL</h3>

<p class='c016'>In 1870, when Mr. Rockefeller was thirty-two
years old, the business was merged into the
Standard Oil Company, starting with a capital
of one million dollars. Other pens have written
the later story of that great corporation;
how it started pipe lines to carry the oil to the
seaboard; how it earned millions in by-products
which had formerly run to waste; how it covered
the markets of the world in its keen search
for trade, distancing all competition, and cheapening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>its own processes so that its dividends in
one year, 1899, amounted to $23,000,000 in
excess of the fixed dividend upon the whole
capital stock. This is the outcome of thirty
years’ development. The corporation is now
the greatest business combination of modern
times, or of any age of the world. Mr. Rockefeller’s
annual income from his holdings of
Standard Oil stock is estimated at about sixteen
millions of dollars.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>MR. ROCKEFELLER’S PERSONALITY</h3>

<p class='c016'>The brains of all this, the owner of the largest
percentage of the stock in the parent corporation,
and in most of the lesser ones, is now
sixty-two years old. His personality is simple
and unaffected, his tastes domestic, and the
trend of his thoughts decidedly religious. His
Cleveland residential estate is superb, covering
a large tract of park-like land,—but even there
he has shown his unselfishness by donating a
large portion of his land to the city for park
purposes. His New York home is not a pretentious
place,—solid, but by no means elegant
in outward appearance. Between the two
homes he divides his time with his wife and
children. He is an earnest and hardworking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>member of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church,
in New York, and does much to promote the
good work carried on by that organization. He
is particularly interested in the Sunday-school
work.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AT THE OFFICE</h3>

<p class='c016'>He arises early in the morning, at his home,
and, after a light breakfast, attends to some of
his personal affairs there. He is always early
on hand at the great Standard Oil building on
lower Broadway, New York, and, during the
day, he transacts business connected with the
management of that vast corporation. There
is hardly one of our business men of whom the
public at large knows so little. He avoids publicity
as most men would the plague. The result
is that he is the only one of our very wealthy
men who maintains the reputation of being different
from the ordinary run of mortals. To
most newspaper readers, he is a man of mystery,
a sort of financial wizard who sits in his
office and heaps up wealth after the fashion of
Aladdin and other fairy-tale heroes.</p>

<p class='c011'>All this is wide of the mark. It would be
hard to find a more commonplace, matter-of-fact
man than John D. Rockefeller. His tall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>form, with the suggestion of a stoop in it, his
pale, thoughtful face and reserved manner,
suggest the scholar or professional man rather
than an industrial Hercules or a Napoleon of
finance. He speaks in a slow, deliberate manner,
weighing each word. There is nothing
impulsive or bombastic about him. But his
conversation impresses one as consisting of
about one hundred per cent. of cold, compact,
boiled-down common sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here is to be noted one characteristic of the
great oil magnate which has helped to make
him what he is. The popular idea of a multi-millionaire
is a man who has taken big risks,
and has come out luckily. He is a living refutation
of this conception. He is careful and
cautious by nature, and he has made these traits
habitual for a lifetime; he conducts all his affairs
on the strictest business principles.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>FORESIGHT</h3>

<p class='c016'>The qualities which have made him so successful
are largely those which go to the making
of any successful business man,—industry,
thrift, perseverance, and foresight. Three of
these qualities would have made him a rich
man; the last has distinguished him as the richest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>man. One of his business associates said of
him, the other day:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe the secret of his success, so far
as there is any secret, lies in power of foresight,
which often seems to his associates to be wonderful.
It comes simply from his habit of looking
at every side of a question, of weighing the
favorable and unfavorable features of a situation,
and of sifting out the inevitable result
through his unfailing good judgment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This is his own personal statement, put into
other words, so it may be accepted as true.
The encouraging part of it is that, while such
foresight as Rockefeller displays may be ascribed
partly to natural endowment, both he
and his friend say that it is more largely a
matter of habit, made effective by continual
practice.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HYGIENE</h3>

<p class='c016'>At noon he takes a very simple lunch at his
club, or at some downtown restaurant. The
lunch usually consists of a bowl of bread and
milk. He remains at the office until late in the
afternoon, and before dinner he takes some
exercise. <i>In winter, he skates when possible.</i>
And at other seasons of the year he nearly always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>drives in the park or on the avenues.
Mr. Rockefeller has great faith in fresh air as a
tonic.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AT HOME</h3>

<p class='c016'>The evenings are nearly always spent at
home, for neither Mr. Rockefeller nor any of
the children are fond of “society,” as the word
is understood in New York. The children
seem to have inherited many of their father’s
sensible ideas, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., has
apparently escaped the fate of most rich men’s
sons. He has a deep sense of responsibility as
the heir-apparent to so much wealth; and, since
his graduation from college, he has devoted
himself to a business career, starting at the bottom
and working upward, step by step. It is
now generally known that he has been very
successful in his business ventures, and he bids
fair to become a worthy successor to his father.
He is now actively engaged in important philanthropic
enterprises in New York. Miss Bessie
became the wife of a poor clergyman of
the Baptist Church in Cleveland; while Miss
Alta is married to a prominent young business
man in Chicago.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>PHILANTHROPY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Rockefeller has during many years
turned over to his children a great many letters
from needy people, asking them to exercise
their own judgment in distributing charities.</p>

<p class='c011'>While he has himself given away millions
for education and charity, he would have given
more were it not for his dread of seeming ostentatious.
But he never gives indiscriminately,
nor out of hand. When a charity appeals to
him, he investigates it thoroughly, just as he
would a business scheme. If he decides that
its object is worthy, he gives liberally; otherwise,
not a cent can be got out of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be imagined that such a man is busy
to the full limit of his working capacity. This
is true. He is too busy for any of the pastimes
and pleasures in which most wealthy men seek
diversion. He is thoroughly devoted to his
home and family, and spends as much as possible
of his time with them. He is a man who
views life seriously, but in his quiet way he can
get as much enjoyment out of a good story or
a meeting with an old friend as can any other
man.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>PERSEVERANCE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>When I asked Mr. Rockefeller what he considers
has most helped him in obtaining success
in business, he answered: “It was early training,
and the fact that I was willing to persevere.
I do not think there is any other quality
so essential to success of any kind as the quality
of perseverance. It overcomes almost everything,
even nature.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be said of his business enterprises,
looking at them in a large way, that he has
given to the world good honest oil, of standard
quality; that his employees are always well
paid; that he has given away more money in
benevolence than any other business man in
America. And everything about the man indicates
that he is likely to “persevere” in the
course he has so long pursued, turning his
vast wealth into institutes for public service.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A GENIUS FOR MONEY MAKING</h3>

<p class='c016'>“There are men born with a genius for
money-making,” says Mathews. “They have
the instinct of accumulation. The talent and
the inclination to convert dollars into doubloons
by bargains or shrewd investments are in them
just as strongly marked and as uncontrollable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>as were the ability and the inclination of
Shakespeare to produce Hamlet and Othello,
of Raphael to paint his cartoons, of Beethoven
to compose his symphonies, or Morse to invent
an electric telegraph. As it would have been a
gross dereliction of duty, a shameful perversion
of gifts, had these latter disregarded the instincts
of their genius and engaged in the
scramble for wealth, so would a Rothschild, an
Astor, and a Peabody have sinned had they
done violence to their natures, and thrown their
energies into channels where they would have
proved dwarfs and not giants.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The opportunity which came to young
Rockefeller does not occur many times in many
ages: and in a generous interpretation of his
opportunity he has already invested a great
deal of his earnings in permanently useful
philanthropies.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Author of the Battle Hymn of the Republic—Her Views of Education for Young Women</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>A&nbsp;POET, author, lecturer, wit and conversationalist,
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe
unites with the attributes of a tender,
womanly nature—which has made her the idol
of her husband and children—the sterner virtues
of a reformer; the unflinching courage
which dares to stand with a small minority in
the cause of right; the indomitable perseverance
and force of character which persist in the
demand for justice in face of the determined
opposition of narrow prejudice and old-time
conservatism.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although more Bostonian than the Bostonians
themselves, Mrs. Howe first saw the light
in New York, and has spent much of her later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>life at Newport. Born in 1819, in a stately
mansion near the Bowling Green, then the most
fashionable quarter of New York, she was the
fourth child of Samuel Ward and Julia Cutler
Ward, people of unusual culture, refinement,
and high ideals. Mr. Ward was a man of spotless
honor and business integrity; and, although
not wealthy as compared with the millionaires
of to-day, his fortune was ample
enough to surround his wife and children with
all the luxuries and refinements that the most
fastidious nature could crave. Mrs. Ward possessed
a rare combination of personal charms
and mental gifts, which endeared her to all who
had the privilege of knowing her. All too soon,
the death angel came and bore away the lovely
young wife and mother, then in her twenty-eighth
year.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rousing himself, with a great effort, from
the grief into which the death of his wife had
plunged him, Mr. Ward devoted himself to the
training, and education of his children. Far
in advance of his age in the matter of higher
education for women he selected as the tutor
of his daughters the learned Doctor Joseph
Green Cogswell, with instruction to teach
them the full curriculum of Harvard college.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>“LITTLE MISS WARD”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The scholarly and refined atmosphere of her
father’s home, which was the resort of the most
distinguished men of letters of the day, was an
admirable school for the development of the
literary and philosophic mind of the “little
Miss Ward,” as Mr. Ward’s eldest daughter
had been called from childhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Learned even beyond advanced college
graduates of to-day, an accomplished linguist,
a musical amateur of great promise, the young
and beautiful Miss Julia Ward, of Bond street,
soon became a leader of the cultured and fashionable
circle in which she moved. In the
series, “Authors at Home,” by M. C. Sherwood,
we get a glimpse of her, about that time,
in a whimsical entry from the diary of a Miss
Hamilton, written at the time of the return
of Doctor Howe, from Greece, whither he had
gone to fight the Turks:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I walked down Broadway with all the
fashion and met the pretty blue stocking, Miss
Julia Ward, with her admirer, Doctor Howe,
just home from Europe. She had on a blue
satin cloak and a white muslin dress. I looked
to see if she had on blue stockings, but I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>not. I suspect that her stockings were pink,
and she wore low slippers, as grandmamma
does. They say she dreams in Italian and
quotes French verses. She sang very prettily
at a party last evening. I noticed how white
her hands were. Still, though attractive, the
muse is not handsome.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SHE MARRIED A REFORMER</h3>

<p class='c016'>Soon after the loss of her father, in 1839,
Miss Ward paid the first of a series of visits to
Boston, where she met, among other distinguished
people who became life-long friends,
Sarah Margaret Fuller, Horace Mann, Charles
Sumner, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. In 1843
she was married to the director of the institute
for the blind, in South Boston, the physician
and reformer, Doctor Samuel G. Howe, of
whom Sydney Smith spoke—referring to the
remarkable results attained in his education of
Laura Bridgman,—as “a modern Pygmalion
who has put life into a statue.” Immediately
after their marriage, Doctor and Mrs. Howe
sailed for Europe, making London their first
stopping place. There they met many famous
men and women, among them Charles Dickens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Thomas Carlyle, Sydney Smith, Thomas
Moore, the Duchess of Sutherland, John Forster,
Samuel Rogers, Richard Monckton
Milnes, and many others. After an extensive
continental tour, including the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy, Doctor
and Mrs. Howe returned home and took up
their residence in South Boston.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of her friends has said: “Mrs. Howe
wrote leading articles from her cradle;” and it
is true that at seventeen, at least, she was an
anonymous but valued contributor to the <i>New
York Magazine</i>, then a prominent periodical.
In 1854, her first volume of poems was published.
She named it “Passion Flowers,” and
the Boston world of letters hailed her as a new
poet. Though published anonymously, the
volume at once revealed its author; and Mrs.
Howe was welcomed into the poetic fraternity
by such shining lights as Emerson, Whittier,
Longfellow, Bryant, and Holmes. The poem
by which the author will be forever enshrined
in her country’s memory is, <i>par excellence</i>,
“The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” which,
like Kipling’s “Recessional,” sang itself at
once into the heart of the nation. As any
sketch of Mrs. Howe would be incomplete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>without the story of the birth of this great
song of America, it is here given in brief.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>STORY OF THE “BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC”</h3>

<p class='c016'>It was in the first year of our Civil War that
Mrs. Howe, in company with her husband and
friends, visited Washington. During their
stay in that city, the party went to see a review
of troops, which, however, was interrupted by
a movement of the enemy, and had to be put
off for the day. The carriage in which Mrs.
Howe was seated with her friends was surrounded
by armed men; and, as they rode
along, she began to sing, to the great delight
of the soldiers, “John Brown.” “Good for
you!” shouted the boys in blue, who, with a
will, took up the refrain. Mrs. Howe then
began conversing with her friends on the momentous
events of the hour, and expressed the
strong desire she felt to write some words
which might be sung to this stirring tune, adding
that she feared she would never be able to
do so. “She went to sleep,” says her daughter,
Maude Howe Eliot, “full of thoughts of
battle, and awoke before dawn the next morning
to find the desired verses immediately present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>to her mind. She sprang from her bed,
and in the dim gray light found a pen, and
paper, whereon she wrote, scarcely seeing
them, the lines of the poem. Returning to her
couch, she was soon asleep, but not until she
had said to herself, ‘I like this better than anything
I have ever written before.’”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“EIGHTY YEARS YOUNG”</h3>

<p class='c016'>Of Mrs. Howe it may very fittingly be said
that she is eighty years young. Her blue eye
retains its brightness, and her dignified carriage
betokens none of the feebleness of age.
Above all, her mind seems to hold, in a marvelous
degree, its youthful vigor and elasticity;
a fact that especially impressed me as the author
of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic”
expressed her views on the desirability of a college
training for girls.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The girls who go to college,” said Mrs.
Howe, “are very much in request, I should say
for everything,—certainly for teaching. Then,
naturally, if they wish to follow literature, they
have a very great advantage over those who
have not had the benefit of a college course,
having a liberal education to begin with.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Which is the greater advantage to a girl,
to have talent or great perseverance?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In order to accomplish anything really
worth doing, I think great perseverance is of
the first importance. On the other hand, one
cannot do a great deal without talent, while
special talent without perseverance never
amounts to much. I once heard Mr. Emerson
say, ‘Genius without character is mere friskiness;’
and we all know of highly gifted people,
who, because lacking the essential quality of
perseverance, accomplish very little in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think the college girl will exercise
a greater influence on modern progress and the
civilization of the future than her untrained
sister?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, very much greater,” was the quick,
emphatic reply. “In the first place, I think
that college-bred girls are quite as likely to
marry as others, and when a college girl marries,
then the whole family is lifted to a higher
plane, the natural result of the well-trained,
cultivated mind. Mothers of old, you know,
were very ignorant. Indeed, it is sad to think
what few advantages they had. Of course,
some of them had opportunities to study alone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>but this solitary study could not accomplish
for them what the colleges, with their corps of
specialists and trained professors, are doing
for the young women of to-day.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE IDEAL COLLEGE</h3>

<p class='c016'>Speaking of the advantages and disadvantages
of coeducational institutions, Mrs. Howe
said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“While there are many advantages in coeducation,
there are also some dangers. The
great advantage consists in the mingling of
both sorts of mind, the masculine and the feminine.
This gives a completeness that cannot
otherwise be obtained. I have observed that
when committees are made up of both men and
women, we get a roundness and completeness
that are lacking when the membership is composed
of either sex alone; and so in college
recitations, where the boys present their side
and the girls theirs, we get better results. This,
of course, is natural. Fortunately, so far,
scandals have been very rare, if found at all,
in coeducation at colleges. Many people, however,
would not care to trust their children,
nor would we send every girl, to such colleges;
and, for this reason, I am glad that we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>women’s colleges. I think, however, that, if
the students are at all earnest, and have high
ideals set before them, the coeducational is the
ideal college; for the course in these colleges
is like a great intellectual race, which arouses
and stimulates all the nobler faculties.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What influence do you think environment
has on one’s career,—on success in life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean by environment?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I mean especially the sort of people
with whom one is associated; their order of
mind?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it has a very important effect. If
we are kept perpetually under lowering influences—lowering
both morally and æsthetically,—the
tendency will inevitably be to drag us
down. I say æsthetically, because I think in
that sense good taste is a part of good morals.
You can, of course, have good taste without
good morals; but with morality there is a certain
feeling or measure of reserve and nicety
which does not accompany good taste without
good morals. You know St. Paul says: ‘Evil
communications corrupt good manners.’ That
is as true to-day as it ever was. We can’t always
be with our equals or our superiors, however;
we must take people as we find them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>But we should try to be with people who stand
for high things, morally and intellectually.
Then, when we have to be among people of a
lower grade, we can help them, because I think
human nature, on the whole, desires to be elevated
rather than lowered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think it is necessary to success in
life to have a special aim?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it is a great thing to have a special
aim or talent, and it is better to make one thing
the leading interest in life than to run after
half-a-dozen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A TALK WITH EDISON</p>

<p class='c022'>DRAMATIC INCIDENTS IN HIS EARLY LIFE</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>TO discover the opinion of Thomas A.
Edison concerning what makes and
constitutes success in life is an easy
matter—if one can first discover Mr. Edison.
I camped three weeks in the vicinity of Orange,
N.J., awaiting the opportunity to come upon
the great inventor and voice my questions. It
seemed a rather hopeless and discouraging
affair until he was really before me; but, truth
to say, he is one of the most accessible of men,
and only reluctantly allows himself to be hedged
in by pressure of endless affairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Edison is always glad to see any visitor,”
said a gentleman who is continually with
him, “except when he is hot on the trail of
something he has been working for, and then
it is as much as a man’s head is worth to come
in on him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He certainly was not hot on the trail of anything
on the morning when, for the tenth time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>I rang at the gate in the fence which surrounds
the laboratory on Valley Road, Orange. A
young man appeared, who conducted me up
the walk to the Edison laboratory office.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE LIBRARY</h3>
<p class='c017'>is a place not to be passed through without
thought, for, with a further store of volumes
in his home, it contains one of the most
costly and well-equipped scientific libraries in
the world; the collection of writings on patent
laws and patents, for instance, is absolutely
exhaustive. It gives, at a glance, an idea of
the breadth of thought and sympathy of this
man who grew up with scarcely a common
school education.</p>
<p class='c011'>On the second floor, in one of the offices of
the machine shop, I was asked to wait, while a
grimy youth disappeared with my card, which
he said he would “slip under the door of Mr.
Edison’s office.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Curious,” I thought; “what a lord this
man must be if they dare not even knock at his
door!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thinking of this and gazing out the window,
I waited until a working man, who had entered
softly, came up beside me. He looked with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>sort of “Well, what is it?” in his eyes, and
quickly it began to come to me that the man in
the sooty, oil-stained clothes was Edison himself.
The working garb seemed rather incongruous,
but there was no mistaking the broad
forehead, with its shock of blackish hair
streaked with gray. The gray eyes, too, were
revelations in the way of alert comprehensiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” was all I could get out at the time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Want to see me?” he said, smiling in the
most youthful and genial way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why,—yes, certainly, to be sure,” I stammered.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked at me blankly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll have to talk louder,” said an assistant
who worked in another portion of the
room; “he don’t hear well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This fact was new to me, but I raised my
voice with celerity, and piped thereafter in an
exceedingly shrill key. After the usual humdrum
opening remarks, in which he acknowledged
his age as fifty-two years, and that he
was born in Erie county, O., of Dutch parentage,
the family having emigrated to America
in 1730, the particulars began to grow more
interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>His great-grandfather, I learned, was a
banker of high standing in New York; and,
when Thomas was but a child of seven years,
the family fortune suffered reverses so serious
as to make it necessary that he should become a
wage-earner at an unusually early age, and
that the family should move from his birth-place
to Michigan.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you enjoy mathematics as a boy?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not much,” he replied. “I tried to read
Newton’s ‘Principia,’ at the age of eleven.
That disgusted me with pure mathematics, and
I don’t wonder now. I should not have been
allowed to take up such serious work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were anxious to learn?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, indeed, <i>I attempted to read through
the entire Free Library at Detroit</i>, but other
things interfered before I had done.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A CHEMICAL NEWSBOY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Were you a book-worm and dreamer?” I
questioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all,” he answered, using a short,
jerky method, as though he were unconsciously
checking himself up. “I became a newsboy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and liked the work. Made my first coup as a
newsboy in 1869.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was it?” I ventured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I bought up on ‘futures’ a thousand copies
of the <i>Detroit Free Press</i> containing important
war news,—gained a little time on my
rivals, and sold the entire batch like hot cakes.
The price reached twenty-five cents a paper
before the end of the route,” and he laughed.
“I ran the <i>Grand Trunk Herald</i>, too, at that
time—a little paper I issued from the train.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When did you begin to be interested in invention?”
I questioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” he said, “I began to dabble in
chemistry at that time. I fitted up a small
laboratory on the train.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In reference to this, Mr. Edison subsequently
admitted that, during the progress of some occult
experiments in this workshop, certain
complications ensued in which a jolted and
broken bottle of sulphuric acid attracted the
attention of the conductor. He, who had been
long suffering in the matter of unearthly odors,
promptly ejected the young devotee and all his
works. This incident would have been only
amusing but for its relation to, and explanation
of, his deafness. A box on the ear, administered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>by the irate conductor, caused the lasting
deafness.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>TELEGRAPHY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What was your first work in a practical
line?” I went on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A telegraph line between my home and
another boy’s, I made with the help of an old
river cable, some stove-pipe wire, and glass-bottle
insulators. I had my laboratory in the
cellar and studied telegraphy outside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was the first really important thing
you did?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saved a boy’s life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The boy was playing on the track near the
depot. I saw he was in danger and caught
him, getting out of the way just in time. His
father was station-master, and taught me telegraphy
in return.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dramatic situations appear at every turn of
this man’s life. He seems to have been continually
arriving on the scene at critical moments,
and always with the good sense to take
things in his own hands. The chance of learning
telegraphy only gave him a chance to show
how apt a pupil he was, and the railroad company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>soon gave him regular employment. At
seventeen, he had become one of the most expert
operators on the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you make much use of your inventive
talent at this time?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” he answered. “I invented an automatic
attachment for my telegraph instrument
which would send in the signal to show I
was awake at my post, when I was comfortably
snoring in a corner. I didn’t do much of that,
though,” he went on; “for some such boyish
trick sent me in disgrace over the line into Canada.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were you there long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only a winter. If it’s incident you want,
I can tell you one of that time. The place
where I was and Sarnier, the American town,
were cut off from telegraphic and other means
of communication by the storms, until I got at
a locomotive whistle and tooted a telegraphic
message. I had to do it again and again, but
eventually they understood over the water and
answered in the same way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>According to his own and various recorded
accounts, Edison was successively in charge of
important wires in Memphis, Cincinnati, New
Orleans, and Louisville. He lived in the free-and-easy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>atmosphere of the tramp operators—a
boon companion with them, yet absolutely
refusing to join in the dissipations to which
they were addicted. So highly esteemed was
he for his honesty, that it was the custom of his
colleagues, when a spree was on hand, to make
him the custodian of those funds which they
felt obliged to save. On a more than usually
hilarious occasion, one of them returned rather
the worse for wear, and knocked the treasurer
down on his refusal to deliver the trust money;
the other depositors, we may be glad to note,
gave the ungentlemanly tippler a sound thrashing.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS USE OF MONEY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Were you good at saving your own
money?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” he said, smiling. “I never was
much for saving money, as money. I devoted
every cent, regardless of future needs, to
scientific books and materials for experiments.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You believe that an excellent way to succeed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it helped me greatly to future success.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>INVENTIONS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“What was your next invention?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An automatic telegraph recorder—a machine
which enabled me to record dispatches at
leisure, and send them off as fast as needed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you come to hit upon that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, at the time, I was in such straits that
I had to walk from Memphis to Louisville. At
the Louisville station they offered me a place.
I had perfected a style of handwriting which
would allow me to take legibly from the wire,
long hand, forty-seven and even fifty-four
words a minute, but I was only a moderately
rapid sender. I had to do something to help
me on that side, and so I thought out that little
device.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Later I discovered an article by one of his
biographers, in which a paragraph referring to
this Louisville period, says:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“True to his dominant instincts, he was not
long in gathering around him a laboratory,
printing-office, and machine shop. He took
press reports during his whole stay, including
on one occasion, the Presidential message, by
Andrew Johnson, and this at one sitting, from
3.30 <span class='sc'>p.m.</span> to 4.30 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“He then paragraphed the matter he had
received over the wires, so that printers had
exactly three lines each, thus enabling them to
set up a column in two or three minutes’ time.
For this, he was allowed all the exchanges he
desired, and the Louisville press gave him a
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you manage to attract public attention
to your ability?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t manage,” said the Wizard.
“Some things I did created comment. A device
that I invented in 1868, which utilized one
sub-marine cable for two circuits, caused considerable
talk, and the Franklin telegraph office
of Boston gave me a position.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is related of this, Mr. Edison’s first trip
East, that he came with no ready money and
in a rather dilapidated condition. His colleagues
were tempted by his “hayseed” appearance
to “salt” him, as professional slang
terms the process of giving a receiver matter
faster than he can record it. For this purpose,
the new man was assigned to a wire manipulated
by a New York operator famous for his
speed. But there was no fun at all. Notwithstanding
the fact that the New Yorker was
in the game and was doing his most speedy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>clip, Edison wrote out the long message accurately,
and, when he realized the situation, was
soon firing taunts over the wire at the sender’s
slowness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had you patented many things up to the
time of your coming East?” I queried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing,” said the inventor, ruminatively.
“I received my first patent in 1869.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A machine for recording votes, and designed
to be used in the State Legislature.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t know such machines were in use,”
I ventured.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They ar’n’t,” he answered, with a merry
twinkle. “The better it worked, the more impossible
it was; the sacred right of the minority,
you know,—couldn’t filibuster if they used
it,—didn’t use it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it was an ingenious thing. Votes were
clearly pointed and shown on a roll of paper,
by a small machine attached to the desk of each
member. I was made to learn that such an
innovation was out of the question, but it
taught me something.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that was?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To be sure of the practical need of, and demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>for, a machine, before expending time
and energy on it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that one of your maxims of success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is. It is a good rule to give people
something they want, and they will pay money
to get it.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS ARRIVAL AT THE METROPOLIS</h3>

<p class='c016'>In this same year, Edison removed from Boston
to New York, friendless and in debt on
account of the expenses of his experiment. For
several weeks he wandered about the town
with actual hunger staring him in the face.
It was a time of great financial excitement, and
with that strange quality of Fortunism, which
seems to be his chief characteristic, he entered
the establishment of the Law Gold Reporting
Company just as their entire plant had shut
down on account of an accident in the machinery
that could not be located. The heads of
the firm were anxious and excited to the last
degree, and a crowd of the Wall street fraternity
waited about for the news which came
not. The shabby stranger put his finger on
the difficulty at once, and was given lucrative
employment. In the rush of the metropolis,
a man finds his true level without delay especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>when his talents are of so practical
and brilliant a nature as were this young telegrapher’s.
It would be an absurdity to imagine
an Edison hidden in New York. Within a
short time, he was presented with a check for
$40,000, as his share of a single invention—an
improved stock printer. From this time,
a national reputation was assured him. He
was, too, now engaged upon the duplex and
quadruplex systems—systems for sending two
and four messages at the same time over a
single wire,—which were to inaugurate almost
a new era in telegraphy.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>MENTAL CONCENTRATION</h3>

<p class='c016'>Recalling the incident of the Law Gold Reporting
Company, I inquired: “Do you believe
want urges a man to greater efforts, and
so to greater success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It certainly makes him keep a sharp look-out.
I think it does push a man along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you believe that invention is a gift, or
an acquired ability?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it’s born in a man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And don’t you believe that familiarity
with certain mechanical conditions and defects
naturally suggests improvements to any one?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“No. Some people may be perfectly familiar
with a machine all their days, knowing it
inefficient, and never see a way to improve it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you think is the first requisite for
success in your field, or any other?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>The ability to apply your physical and
mental energies to one problem incessantly
without growing weary.</i>”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>TWENTY HOURS A DAY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Do you have regular hours, Mr. Edison?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” he said, “I do not work hard now.
I come to the laboratory about eight o’clock
every day and go home to tea at six, and then I
study or work on some problem until eleven,
which is my hour for bed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fourteen of fifteen hours a day can scarcely
be called loafing,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” he replied, “for fifteen years I have
worked on an average of twenty hours a day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When he was forty-seven years old, he estimated
his true age at eighty-two, since working
only eight hours a day would have taken
till that time.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Edison has sometimes worked sixty
consecutive hours upon one problem. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>after a long sleep, he was perfectly refreshed
and ready for another.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A RUN FOR BREAKFAST</h3>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Dickson, a neighbor and familiar, gives
an anecdote told by Edison which well illustrates
his untiring energy and phenomenal endurance.
In describing his Boston experience,
Edison said he bought Faraday’s works on
electricity, commenced to read them at three
o’clock in the morning and continued until his
room-mate arose, when they started on their
long walk to get breakfast. That object was
entirely subordinated in Edison’s mind to
Faraday, and he suddenly remarked to his
friend: “‘Adams, I have got so much to do,
and life is so short, that I have got to hustle,’
and with that I started off on a dead run for my
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve known Edison since he was a boy of
fourteen,” said another friend; “and of my
own knowledge I can say he never spent an idle
day in his life. Often, when he should have
been asleep, I have known him to sit up half the
night reading. He did not take to novels or
wild Western adventures, but read works on
mechanics, chemistry, and electricity; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>mastered them too. But in addition to his
reading, which he could only indulge in at odd
hours, he carefully cultivated his wonderful
powers of observation, till at length, when he
was not actually asleep, it may be said he was
learning all the time.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>NOT BY ACCIDENT AND NOT FOR FUN</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Are your discoveries often brilliant intuitions?
Do they come to you while you are
lying awake nights?” I asked him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never did anything worth doing by accident,”
he replied, “nor did any of my inventions
come indirectly through accident, except
the phonograph.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c019'><sup>[4]</sup></a> No, when I have fully decided
that a result is worth getting, I go about
it, and make trial after trial, until it comes.”</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f4'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“I was singing to the mouthpiece of a telephone,”
said Edison, “when the vibrations of my voice caused a
fine steel point to pierce one of my fingers held just behind
it. That set me to thinking. If I could record
the motions of the point and send it over the same surface
afterward, I saw no reason why the thing would
not talk. I determined to make a machine that would
work accurately, and gave my assistants the necessary
instructions, telling them what I had discovered.
That’s the whole story. The phonograph is the result
of the pricking of a finger.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“I have always kept,” continued Mr. Edison,
“strictly within the lines of commercially
useful inventions. I have never had any time
to put on electrical wonders, valuable only as
novelties to catch the popular fancy.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“I LIKE IT—I HATE IT”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What makes you work?” I asked with
real curiosity. “What impels you to this constant,
tireless struggle? You have shown that
you care comparatively nothing for the money
it makes you, and you have no particular enthusiasm
for the attending fame. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like it,” he answered, after a moment of
puzzled expression. “I don’t know any other
reason. Anything I have begun is always on
my mind, and I am not easy while away from
it, until it is finished; and then I hate it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hate it?” I said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” he affirmed, “when it is all done
and is a success, I can’t bear the sight of it.
I haven’t used a telephone in ten years, and I
would go out of my way any day to miss an
incandescent light.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c019'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f5'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“After I have completed an invention,” remarked
Edison, upon another occasion, “I seem to lose interest
in it. One might think that the money value of an invention
constitutes its reward to the man who loves his
work. But, speaking for myself, I can honestly say
this is not so. Life was never more full of joy to me,
than when, a poor boy, I began to think out improvements
in telegraphy, and to experiment with the cheapest
and crudest appliances. But now that I have all the
appliances I need, and am my own master, I continue
to find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the
work that precedes what the world calls success.”</p>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>DOING ONE THING EIGHTEEN HOURS IS THE SECRET</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“You lay down rather severe rules for one
who wishes to succeed in life,” I ventured,
“working eighteen hours a day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all,” he said. “You do something
all day long, don’t you? Every one does. If
you get up at seven o’clock and go to bed at
eleven, you have put in sixteen good hours,
and it is certain with most men, that they have
been doing something all the time. They have
been either walking, or reading, or writing, or
thinking. The only trouble is that they do it
about a great many things and I do it about
one. If they took the time in question and
applied it in one direction, to one object, they
would succeed. Success is sure to follow such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>application. The trouble lies in the fact that
people do not have an object—one thing to
which they stick, letting all else go. Success
is the product of the severest kind of mental
and physical application.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>POSSIBILITIES IN THE ELECTRICAL FIELD</h3>

<p class='c016'>“You believe, of course,” I suggested, “that
much remains to be discovered in the realm of
electricity?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the field of fields,” he answered. “We
can’t talk of that, but it holds the secrets which
will reorganize the life of the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have discovered much about it,” I
said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” he said, “and yet very little in comparison
with the possibilities that appear.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>ONLY SIX HUNDRED INVENTIONS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“How many inventions have you patented?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only six hundred,” he answered, “but I
have made application for some three hundred
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And do you expect to retire soon, after all
this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope not,” he said, almost pathetically.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“I hope I will be able to work right on to the
close. I shouldn’t care to loaf.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS COURTSHIP AND HIS HOME</h3>

<p class='c016'>The idea of the great electrician’s marrying
was first suggested by an intimate friend, who
told him that his large house and numerous
servants ought to have a mistress. Although
a very shy man, he seemed pleased with the
proposition, and timidly inquired whom he
should marry. The friend, annoyed at his apparent
want of sentiment, somewhat testily replied,—“Anyone.”
But Edison was not without
sentiment when the time came. One day,
as he stood behind the chair of a Miss Stillwell,
a telegraph operator in his employ, he was not
a little surprised when she suddenly turned
round and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Edison, I can always tell when you are
behind me or near me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now Miss Stillwell’s turn to be surprised,
for, with characteristic bluntness and
ardor, Edison fronted the young lady, and,
looking her full in the face, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve been thinking considerably about you
of late, and, if you are willing to marry me, I
would like to marry you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The young lady said she would consider the
matter, and talk it over with her mother. The
result was that they were married a month later,
and the union proved a very happy one.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in fact no more an accident than other
experiments in the Edison laboratory—his
bride having been long the subject of the Wizzard’s
observation—her mental capacity, her
temper and temperament, her aptitude for
home-making being duly tested and noted.</p>

<p class='c013'>A FASCINATING STORY</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>BY GENERAL LEW WALLACE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c018'>IN his study, a curiously-shaped building
lighted from the top, and combining in
equal portions the Byzantine, Romanesque
and Doric styles of architecture, the gray-haired
author of “Ben-Hur,” surrounded by
his pictures, books, and military trophies, is
spending, in serene and comfortable retirement,
the evening of his life. As I sat beside him,
the other day, and listened to the recital of his
earlier struggles and later achievements, I
could not help contrasting his dignified bearing,
careful expression, and gentle demeanor, with
another occasion in his life, when, as a vigorous,
black-haired young military officer, in the
spring of 1861, he appeared, with flashing eye
and uplifted sword, at the head of his regiment,
the gallant and historic Eleventh Indiana Volunteers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>General Wallace never repels a visitor, and
his greeting is cordial and ingenuous.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I could say anything to stimulate or encourage
the young men of to-day,” he said, “I
would gladly do so, but I fear that the story of
my early days would be of very little interest
or value to others. So far as school education
is concerned, it may be truthfully said that I
had but little, if any; and if, in spite of that
deficiency, I ever arrived at proficiency, I
reached it, I presume, as Topsy attained her
stature,—‘just growed into it.’”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A BOYHOOD OF WASTED OPPORTUNITIES</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Were you denied early school advantages?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not in the least. On the contrary, I had
most abundant opportunity in that respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father was a lawyer, enjoying a lucrative
practice in Brookville, Indiana,—a small
town which bears the distinction of having
given to the world more prominent men than
any other place in the Hoosier State. Not long
after my birth, he was elected lieutenant-governor,
and, finally, governor of the state. He,
himself, was an educated man, having been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>graduated from the United States Military
Academy at West Point, and having served as
instructor in mathematics there. He was not
only an educated man, but a man of advanced
ideas generally, as shown by the fact that <i>he
failed of a re-election to congress in 1840, because,
as a member of the committee on commerce,
he gave the casting vote in favor of an
appropriation to develop Morse’s magnetic telegraph</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, he believed in the value, and
tried to impress upon me the necessity of a
thorough school training. But, in the face of
all the solicitude and encouragement which an
indulgent father could waste on an unappreciative
son, I remained vexatiously indifferent.
I presume I was like some man in history,—it
was Lincoln, I believe,—who said that his father
taught him to work, but he never quite
succeeded in teaching him to love it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father sent me to school, and regularly
paid tuition,—for in those days there were no
free schools; but, much to my discredit, he
failed to secure anything like regular attendance
at recitations, or even a decent attempt to
master my lessons at any time. In fact, much
of the time that should have been given to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>school was spent in fishing, hunting, and roaming
through the woods.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HIS BOYHOOD LOVE FOR HISTORY AND LITERATURE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“But were you thus indifferent to all forms
of education?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, my case was not quite so hopeless as
that. I did not desert the schools entirely, but
my attendance was so provokingly irregular
and my indifference so supreme, I wonder now
that I was tolerated at all. But I had one
mainstay; I loved to read. I was a most inordinate
reader. In some lines of literature,
especially history and some kinds of fiction, my
appetite was insatiate, and many a day, while
my companions were clustered together in the
old red brick schoolhouse, struggling with
their problems in fractions or percentage, I
was carefully hidden in the woods near by,
lying upon my elbows, munching an apple, and
reveling in the beauties of Plutarch, Byron or
Goldsmith.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you not attend college, or the higher
grade of schools?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, for a brief period. My brother was
a student in Wabash College,—here in Crawfordsville,—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>hither I also was sent; but
within six weeks I had tired of the routine, was
satiated with discipline, and made my exit from
the institution.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall never forget what my father did
when I returned home. He called me into his
office, and, reaching into one of the pigeon-holes
above his desk, withdrew therefrom a
package of papers neatly folded and tied with
the conventional red tape. He was a very systematic
man, due, perhaps, to his West Point
training, and these papers proved to be the receipts
for my tuition, which he had carefully
preserved. He called off the items, and asked
me to add them together. The total, I confess,
staggered me.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A FATHER’S FRUITFUL WARNING</h3>

<p class='c016'>“‘That sum, my son,’ he said, with a tone
of regret in his voice, ‘represents what I have
expended in these many years past to provide
you with a good education. How successful I
have been, you know better than anyone else.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘After mature reflection, I have come to
the conclusion that I have done for you in that
direction all that can reasonably be expected of
any parent; and I have, therefore, called you in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>to tell you that you have now reached an age
when you must take up the lines yourself. If
you have failed to profit by the advantages
with which I have tried so hard to surround
you, the responsibility must be yours. I shall
not upbraid you for your neglect, but rather
pity you for the indifference which you have
shown to the golden opportunities you have,
through my indulgence, been enabled to enjoy.’”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A MANHOOD OF SPLENDID EFFORT</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What effect did his admonition have on
you? Did it awaken or arouse you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It aroused me, most assuredly. It set me
to thinking as nothing before had done. The
next day, I set out with a determination to accomplish
something for myself. My father’s
injunction rang in my ears. New responsibilities
rested on my shoulders, as I was, for the
first time in my life, my own master. I felt
that I must get work on my own account.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After much effort, I finally obtained employment
from the man with whom I had
passed so many afternoons strolling up and
down the little streams in the neighborhood,
trying to fish. He was the county clerk, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>he hired me to copy what was known as the
complete record of one of the courts. I
worked for months in a dingy, half-lighted
room, receiving for my pay something like ten
cents per hundred words. The tediousness
and</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE REGULARITY OF THE WORK WAS A SPLENDID DRILL FOR ME,</h3>
<p class='c017'>and taught me the virtue of persistence as one
of the avenues of success. It was at this time
I began to realize <i>the deficiency in my education</i>,
especially as I had an ambition to become
a lawyer. Being deficient in both mathematics
and grammar, <i>I was forced to study evenings</i>.
Of course, the latter was a very exacting study,
after a full day’s hard work; but I was made
to realize that <i>the time I had spent with such
lavish prodigality could not be recovered</i>, and
that I must extract every possible good out of
the golden moments then flying by all too fast.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SELF-EDUCATION BY READING AND LITERARY COMPOSITION</h3>
<p class='c016'>“Had you a distinct literary ambition at
that time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I had always had a sort of literary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>bent or inclination. I read all the literature
of the day, besides the standard authors, and
finally began to devote my odd moments to a
book of my own,—a tale based on the days of
the crusades. When completed, it covered
about three hundred and fifty pages, and bore
the rather high-sounding title, ‘The Man-at-Arms.’
I read a good portion of it before a
literary society to which I belonged; the members
applauded it, and I was frequently urged
to have it published.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Mexican War soon followed, however,
and I took the manuscript with me when
I enlisted. But before the close of my service
it was lost, and my production, therefore, never
reached the public eye.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But did not the approval which the book
received from the few persons who read it encourage
you to continue writing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fully fifty years have elapsed since then,
and it is, therefore, rather difficult, at this late
day, to recall just how such things affected me.
I suppose I was encouraged thereby, for, in
due course of time, another book which turned
out to be</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>“THE FAIR GOD”</h3>
</div>
<p class='c017'>my first book to reach the public,—began to
shape itself in my mind. The composition of
this work was not, as the theatrical people
would say, a continuous performance, for there
were many and singular interruptions; and it
would be safe to say that months, and, in one
case, years, intervened between certain chapters.
A few years after the war, I finished the
composition, strung the chapters into a continuous
narrative, leveled up the uneven places,
and started East with the manuscript. A letter
from Whitelaw Reid, then editor of the
New York <i>Tribune</i>, introduced me to the
head of one of the leading publishing houses
in Boston. There I was kindly received, and
delivered my manuscript, which was referred
to a professional reader, to determine its literary,
and also, I presume, its commercial
value.</p>
<p class='c011'>“It would be neither a new nor an interesting
story to acquaint the public with the degree
of anxious suspense that pervaded my mind
when I withdrew to await the reader’s judgment.
Every other writer has, I assume, at one
time or another, undergone much the same experience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>It was not long until I learned from
the publisher that the reader reported in favor
of my production. Publication soon followed,
and for the first time, in a literary sense, I
found myself before the public, and my book
before the critics.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE ORIGIN OF “BEN-HUR”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“How long after this did ‘Ben-Hur’ appear,
and what led you to write it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I began ‘Ben-Hur’ about 1876, and it was
published in 1880. The purpose, at first, was
a short serial for one of the magazines, descriptive
of the visit of the wise men to Jerusalem
as mentioned in the first two verses of
the second chapter of Matthew. It will be
recognized in ‘Book First’ of the work as now
published. For certain reasons, however, the
serial idea was abandoned, and the narrative,
instead of ending with the birth of the Saviour,
expanded into a more pretentious novel and
only ended with the death scene on Calvary.
The last ten chapters were written in the old
adobe palace at Santa Fé, New Mexico, where
I was serving as governor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is difficult to answer the question, ‘what
led me to write the book;’ or why I chose a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>piece of fiction which used Christ as its leading
character. In explanation, it is proper to
state that I had reached an age in life when
men usually begin to study themselves with
reference to their fellowmen, and reflect on the
good they may have done in the world. <i>Up to
that time, never having read the Bible</i>, I knew
nothing about sacred history; and, in matters
of a religious nature, although I was not in
every respect an infidel, I was persistently and
notoriously indifferent. <i>I did not know, and
therefore, did not care.</i> I resolved to begin the
study of the good book in earnest.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>INFLUENCE OF THE STORY OF THE CHRIST UPON THE AUTHOR</h3>

<p class='c016'>“I was in quest of knowledge, but I had no
faith to sustain, no creed to bolster up. The
result was that the whole field of religious and
biblical history opened up before me; and, my
vision not being clouded by previously formed
opinions, I was enabled to survey it without the
aid of lenses. I believe I was thorough and persistent.
I know I was conscientious in my
search for the truth. I weighed, I analyzed, I
counted and compared. The evolution from
conjecture into knowledge, through opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>and belief, was gradual but irresistible; and at
length I stood firmly and defiantly on the solid
rock.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upward of seven hundred thousand copies
of ‘Ben-Hur’ have been published, and it has
been translated into all languages from French
to Arabic. But, whether it has ever influenced
the mind of a single reader or not, I am sure
its conception and preparation—if it has done
nothing more—have convinced its author of the
divinity of the lowly Nazarene who walked and
talked with God.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>“THERE is no doubt,” said Mr. Carnegie,
in reply to a question from
me, “that it is becoming harder
and harder, as business gravitates more and
more to immense concerns, for a young man
without capital to get a start for himself,
and in the large cities it is especially so,
where large capital is essential. Still it
can be honestly said that there is no
other country in the world, where able and
energetic young men and women can so readily
rise as in this. A president of a business college
informed me, recently, that he has never
been able to supply the demand for capable,
first-class [Mark the adjective.] bookkeepers,
and his college has over nine hundred students.
In America, young men of ability rise with
most astonishing rapidity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As quickly as when you were a boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“Much more so. When I was a boy, there
were but very few important positions that a
boy could aspire to. Every position had to be
made. Now a boy doesn’t need to make the
place,—all he has to do is to fit himself to take

<h3 class='c015'>EARLY WORK AND WAGES</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Where did you begin life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In Dunfermline, Scotland, during my earliest
years. The service of my life has all been
in this country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In Pittsburg?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Largely so. My father settled in Allegheny
City, when I was only ten years old, and
I began to earn my way in Pittsburg.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you mind telling me what your first
service was?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all. I was a bobbin boy in a cotton
factory, then an engine-man or boy in the same
place, and later still I was a messenger boy for
a telegraph company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At small wages, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One dollar and twenty cents a week was
what I received as a bobbin boy, and I considered
it pretty good, at that. When I was thirteen,
I had learned to run a steam engine, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>for that I received a dollar and eighty cents a
week.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>COLONEL ANDERSON’S BOOKS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“There were no fine libraries then, but in
Allegheny City, where I lived, there was a
certain Colonel Anderson, who was well to do
and of a philanthropic turn. He announced,
about the time I first began to work, that he
would be in his library at home, every Saturday,
ready to lend books to working boys and
men. He had only about four hundred volumes,
but I doubt if ever so few books were put
to better use. Only he who has longed, as I
did for Saturday to come, that the spring of
knowledge might be opened anew to him, can
understand what Colonel Anderson did for me
and others of the boys of Allegheny. Quite a
number of them have risen to eminence, and I

  <h3 class='c015'>HIS FIRST GLIMPSE OF PARADISE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“How long did you remain an engine-boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not very long,” Mr. Carnegie replied;
“perhaps a year.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I entered a telegraph office as a messenger
boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Although Mr. Carnegie did not dwell much
on this period, he once described it at a dinner
given in honor of the American Consul at Dunfermline,
Scotland, when he said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I awake from a dream that has carried me
away back to the days of my boyhood, the day
when the little white-haired Scottish laddie,
dressed in a blue jacket, walked with his father
into the telegraph office in Pittsburg to undergo
examination as an applicant for a position as
messenger boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well I remember when my uncle spoke to
my parents about it, and my father objected,
because I was then getting one dollar and
eighty cents per week for running the small
engine in a cellar in Allegheny City, but my
uncle said a messenger’s wages would be two
dollars and fifty cents.... If you want
an idea as to heaven on earth, imagine what it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>is to be taken from a dark cellar, where I fired
the boiler from morning until night, and dropped
into an office, where light shone from all
sides, with books, papers, and pencils in profusion
around me, and oh, the tick of those
mysterious brass instruments on the desk, annihilating
space and conveying intelligence to
the world. This was my first glimpse of paradise,
and I walked on air.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you manage to rise from this
position?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I learned how to operate a telegraph instrument,
and then waited an opportunity to
show that I was fit to be an operator. Eventually
my chance came.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The truth is that James D. Reid, the superintendent
of the office, and himself a Scotchman,
favored the ambitious lad. In his “History
of the Telegraph,” he says of him:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I liked the boy’s looks, and it was easy to
see that, though he was little, he was full of
spirit. He had not been with me a month when
he asked me to teach him to telegraph. He
spent all his spare time in practice, sending and
receiving by sound and not by tape, as was the
custom in those days. Pretty soon he could do
as well as I could at the key.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>INTRODUCED TO A BROOM</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“As you look back upon it,” I said to Mr.
Carnegie, “do you consider that so lowly a
beginning is better than one a little less
trying?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For young men starting upon their life
work, it is much the best to begin as I did, at
the beginning, and occupy the most subordinate
positions. Many of the present-day leading
men of Pittsburg, had serious responsibility
thrust upon them at the very threshold of their
careers. They were introduced to the broom,
and spent the first hours of their business life
sweeping out the office. I notice we have janitors
and janitresses now in offices, and our
young men, unfortunately, miss that salutary
branch of early education. It does not hurt the
newest comer to sweep out the office.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many’s the time. And who do you suppose
were my fellow sweepers? David McBargo,
afterwards superintendent of the Allegheny
Valley Railroad; Robert Pitcairn, afterwards
superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad;
and Mr. Mooreland, subsequently City Attorney
of Pittsburg. We all took turns, two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>each morning doing the sweeping; and now I
remember Davie was so proud of his clean
shirt bosom that he used to spread over it an old
silk handkerchief which he kept for the purpose,
and we other boys thought he was putting
on airs. So he was. None of us had a silk
handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“After you had learned to telegraph, did you
consider that you had reached high enough?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just at that time my father died, and the
burden of the support of the family fell upon
me. I earned as an operator twenty-five dollars
a month, and a little additional money by
copying telegraphic messages for the newspapers,
and managed to keep the family independent.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AN EXPERT TELEGRAPHER</h3>

<p class='c016'>More light on this period of Mr. Carnegie’s
career is given by the “<i>Electric Age</i>,” which
says:—“As a telegraph operator he was abreast
of older and experienced men; and, although
receiving messages by sound was, at that time,
forbidden by authority as being unsafe, young
Carnegie quickly acquired the art, and he can
still stand behind the ticker and understand
its language. As an operator, he delighted in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>full employment and the prompt discharge of
business, and a big day’s work was his chief
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long did you remain with the telegraph
company?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Until I was given a place by the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As an operator?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At first,—until I showed how the telegraph
could minister to railroad safety and success;
then I was made secretary to Thomas A. Scott,
the superintendent; and not long afterwards,
when Colonel Scott became vice-president, I
was made superintendent of the western
division.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Colonel Scott’s attention was drawn to Carnegie
by the operator’s devising a plan for running
trains by telegraph, so making the most
of a single track. Up to this time no one had
ever dreamed of running trains in opposite directions,
towards each other, directing them by
telegraph, one train being sidetracked while the
other passed. The boy studied out a train-despatching
system which was afterwards used
on every single-track railroad in the country.
Nobody had ever thought of this before, and
the officials were so pleased with the ingenious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>lad, that they placed him in charge of a division
office, and before he was twenty made him superintendent
of the western division of the
road.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>WHAT EMPLOYERS THINK OF YOUNG MEN</h3>

<p class='c016'>Concerning this period of his life, I asked
Mr. Carnegie if his promotion was not a matter
of chance, and whether he did not, at the time,
feel it to be so. His answer was emphatic.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never. Young men give all kinds of reasons
why, in their cases, failure is attributable
to exceptional circumstances, which rendered
success impossible. Some never had a chance,
according to their own story. This is simply
nonsense. No young man ever lived who had
not a chance, and a splendid chance, too, if he
was ever employed at all. He is assayed in the
mind of his immediate superior, from the day
he begins work, and, after a time, if he has
merit, he is assayed in the council chambers of
the firm. His ability, honesty, habits, associations,
temper, disposition,—all these are
weighed and analyzed. The young man who
never had a chance is the same young man who
has been canvassed over and over again by his
superiors, and found destitute of necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>qualifications, or is deemed unworthy of closer
relations with the firm, owing to some objectionable
act, habit or association, of which he
thought his employers ignorant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It sounds true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE RIGHT MEN IN DEMAND</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Another class of young men attributes
failure to rise to employers having near
relatives or favorites whom they advance unfairly.
They also insist that their employers
dislike brighter intelligences than their own,
and are disposed to discourage aspiring genius,
and delighted in keeping young men down.
There is nothing in this. On the contrary, there
is no one suffering more for lack of the right
man in the right place as the average employer,
nor anyone more anxious to find him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was this your theory on the subject when
you began working for the railroad company?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had no theory then, although I have
formulated one since. It lies mainly in this:
Instead of the question, ‘What must I do for
my employer?’ substitute, ‘What can I do?’
Faithful and conscientious discharge of duties
assigned you is all very well, but the verdict in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>such cases generally is that you perform your
present duties so well, that you would better
continue performing them. Now, this will not
do. It will not do for the coming partners.
There must be something beyond this. We
make clerks, bookkeepers, treasurers, bank tellers
of this class, and there they remain to the
end of the chapter. <i>The rising man must do
something exceptional, and beyond the range
of his special department. He must attract attention.</i>”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HOW TO ATTRACT ATTENTION</h3>

<p class='c016'>“How can he do that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if he is a shipping clerk, he may do
so by discovering in an invoice an error with
which he has nothing to do and which has escaped
the attention of the proper party. If a
weighing clerk, he may save for the firm in
questioning the adjustment of the scales, and
having them corrected, even if this be the province
of the master mechanic. If a messenger
boy, he can lay the seed of promotion by going
beyond the letter of his instructions in order
to secure the desired reply. There is no service
so low and simple, neither any so high, in which
the young man of ability and willing disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>cannot readily and almost daily prove himself
capable of greater trust and usefulness,
and, what is equally important, show his invincible
determination to rise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In what manner did you reach out to establish
your present great fortune?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By saving my money. I put a little money
aside, and it served me later as a matter of
credit. Also, I invested in a sleeping-car industry,
which paid me well.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SLEEPING-CAR INVENTION</h3>

<p class='c016'>Although I tried earnestly to get the great
iron-king to talk of this, he said little, because
the matter has been fully dealt with by him in
his “Triumphant Democracy.” From his own
story there, it appears that one day at this time,
when Mr. Carnegie still had his fortune to
make, he was on a train examining the line
from a rear window of a car, when a tall, spare
man, accosted him and asked him to look at an
invention he had made. He drew from a green
bag a small model of a sleeping-berth for railway
cars, and proceeded to point out its advantages.
It was Mr. T. T. Woodruff, the inventor
of the sleeping-car. As Mr. Carnegie
tells the story:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“He had not spoken a moment before, like
a flash, the whole range of the discovery burst
upon me. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘that is something
which this continent must have,’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upon my return, I laid it before Mr. Scott,
declaring that it was one of the inventions of
the age. He remarked: ‘You are enthusiastic,
young man, but you may ask the inventor
to come and let me see it.’ I did so, and arrangements
were made to build two trial cars,
and run them on the Pennsylvania Railroad. I
was offered an interest in the venture, which
I gladly accepted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The notice came that my share of the first
payment was $217.50. How well I remember
the exact sum. But two hundred and seventeen
dollars and a half were as far beyond my means
as if it had been millions. I was earning fifty
dollars per month, however, and had prospects,
or at least I always felt that I had. I decided to
call on the local banker and boldly ask him to
advance the sum upon my interest in the affair.
He put his hand on my shoulder and said:
‘Why, of course, Andie; you are all right. Go
ahead. Here is the money.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a proud day for a man when he pays
his last note, but not to be named in comparison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>with the day in which he makes his first one, and
gets a banker to take it. I have tried both, and I
know. The cars furnished the subsequent payments
by their earnings. I paid my first note
from my savings, so much per month, and thus
I got my foot upon fortune’s ladder. It was
easy to climb after that.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE MARK OF A MILLIONAIRE</h3>

<p class='c016'>“I would like some expression from you,”
I said to Mr. Carnegie, “in reference to the
importance of laying aside money from one’s
earnings, as a young man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can have it. There is one sure mark
of the coming partner, the future millionaire;
his revenues always exceed his expenditures.
He begins to save early, almost as soon as he
begins to earn. I should say to young men,
no matter how little it may be possible to save,
save that little. Invest it securely, not necessarily
in bonds, but in anything which you have
good reason to believe will be profitable. Some
rare chance will soon present itself for investment.
The little you have saved will prove the
basis for an amount of credit utterly surprising
to you. Capitalists trust the saving man.
For every hundred dollars you can produce as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>the result of hard-won savings, Midas, in
search of a partner, will lend or credit a thousand;
for every thousand, fifty thousand. <i>It is
not capital that your seniors require, it is the
man who has proved that he has the business
habits which create capital. So it is the first
hundred dollars that tell.</i>”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AN OIL FARM</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What,” I asked Mr. Carnegie, “was the
next enterprise with which you identified yourself?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In company with several others, I purchased
the now famous Storey farm, on Oil
Creek, Pennsylvania, where a well had been
bored and natural oil struck the year before.
This proved a very profitable investment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In “Triumphant Democracy,” Mr. Carnegie
has expatiated most fully on this venture,
which is so important. “When I first visited
this famous well,” he says, “the oil was running
into the creek, where a few flat-bottomed
scows lay filled with it, ready to be floated
down the Alleghany River, on an agreed-upon
day each week, when the creek was flooded by
means of a temporary dam. This was the beginning
of the natural-oil business. We purchased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the farm for $40,000, and so small was
our faith in the ability of the earth to yield for
any considerable time the hundred barrels per
day, which the property was then producing,
that we decided to make a pond capable of
holding one hundred thousand barrels of oil,
which, we estimated, would be worth, when the
supply ceased, $1,000,000.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unfortunately for us, the pond leaked fearfully;
evaporation also caused much loss, but
we continued to run oil in to make the losses
good day after day, until several hundred thousand
barrels had gone in this fashion. Our
experience with the farm is worth reciting:
its value rose to $5,000,000; that is—the shares
of the company sold in the market upon this
basis; and one year it paid cash dividends of
$1,000,000—upon an investment of $40,000.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>IRON BRIDGES</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Were you satisfied to rest with these enterprises
in your hands?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. Railway bridges were then built almost
exclusively of wood, but the Pennsylvania
Railroad had begun to experiment with cast-iron.
It struck me that the bridge of the future
must be of iron; and I organized, in Pittsburg,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>a company for the construction of iron bridges.
That was the Keystone Bridge Works. We
built the first iron bridge across the Ohio.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His entrance of the realm of steel was much
too long for Mr. Carnegie to discuss, although
he was not unwilling to give information relating
to the subject. It appears that he realized
the immensity of the steel manufacturing business
at once. The Union Iron Mills soon followed
as one of the enterprises, and, later, the
famous Edgar Thompson Steel Rail Mill. The
last was the outcome of a visit to England, in
1868, when Carnegie noticed that English railways
were discarding iron for steel rails. The
Bessemer process had been then perfected, and
was making its way in all the iron-producing
countries. Carnegie, recognizing that it was
destined to revolutionize the iron business, introduced
it into his mills and made steel rails
with which he was enabled to compete with
English manufacturers.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HOMESTEAD STEEL WORKS</h3>

<p class='c016'>His next enterprise was the purchase of the
Homestead Steel Works,—his great rival in
Pittsburg. In 1888, he had built or acquired
seven distinct iron and steel works, all of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>are now included in the Carnegie Steel Company,
Limited. All the plants of this great firm
are within a radius of five miles of Pittsburg.
Probably in no other part of the world can be
found such an aggregation of splendidly equipped
steel works as those controlled by this association.
It now comprises the Homestead
Steel Works, the Edgar Thompson Steel
Works and Furnaces, the Duquesne Steel
Works and Furnaces, all within two miles of
one another; the Lucy Furnaces, the Keystone
Bridge Works, the Upper Union Rolling Mills,
and the Lower Union Rolling Mills.</p>

<p class='c011'>In all branches, including the great coke
works, mines, etc., there are employed twenty-five
thousand men. The monthly pay roll exceeds
one million, one hundred and twenty-five
thousand dollars, or nearly fifty thousand dollars
for each working day. Including the Frick
Coke Company, the united capital of the Carnegie
Steel Company exceeds sixty million
dollars.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A STRENGTHENING POLICY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“You believe in taking active measures,” I
said, “to make men successful.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i270fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><i>Partial view of the Homestead Steel Works.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“I believe in anything which will help men
to help themselves. To induce them to save,
every workman in our company is allowed to
deposit part of his earnings, not exceeding two
thousand dollars, with the firm, on which the
high interest rate of six per cent. is allowed.
The firm also lends to any of its workmen to
buy a lot, or to build a house, taking its pay by
installments.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has this contributed to the success of your
company?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think so. The policy of giving a personal
interest to the men who render exceptional
service is strengthening. With us there
are many such, and every year several more
are added as partners. It is the policy of the
concern to interest every superintendent in the
works, every head of a department, every exceptional
young man. Promotion follows exceptional
service, and there is no favoritism.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>PHILANTHROPY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“All you have said so far, merely gives the
idea of getting money, without any suggestion
as to the proper use of great wealth. Will you
say something on that score?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“My views are rather well known, I think.
What a man owns is already subordinate, in
America, to what he knows; but in the final
aristocracy, the question will not be either of
these, but what has he done for his fellows?
Where has he shown generosity and self-abnegation?
Where has he been a father to the
fatherless? And the cause of the poor, where
has he searched that out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>That Mr. Carnegie has lived up in the past,
and is still living up to this radical declaration
of independence from the practice of men who
have amassed fortunes around him, will be best
shown by a brief enumeration of some of his
almost unexampled philanthropies. His largest
gift has been to the city of Pittsburg, the
scene of his early trials and later triumphs.
There he has built, at a cost of more than a
million dollars, a magnificent library, museum,
concert hall and picture gallery, all under one
roof, and endowed it with a fund of another million,
the interest of which (fifty thousand dollars
per annum) is being devoted to the purchase
of the best works of American art. Other
libraries, to be connected with this largest as a
center, are now being constructed, which will
make the city of Pittsburg and its environs a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>beneficiary of his generosity to the extent of
five million dollars.</p>

<p class='c011'>While thus endowing the city where his fortune
was made, he has not forgotten other
places endeared to him by association or by
interest. To the Allegheny Free Library he
has given $375,000; to the Braddock Free Library,
$250,000; to the Johnstown Free Library,
$50,000; and to the Fairfield (Iowa)
Library, $40,000. To the Cooper Institute,
New York, he has given $300,000. To his native
land he has been scarcely less generous. To
the Edinburgh Free Library he has given
$250,000, and to his native town of Dunfermline,
$90,000. Other Scottish towns to the
number of ten have received helpful donations
of amounts not quite so large. He has given
$50,000 to aid poor young men and women
to gain a musical education at the Royal College
of Music in London.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING RICH MEN’S SONS”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“I should like to cause you to say some other
important things for young men to learn and
benefit by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our young partners in the Carnegie company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>have all won their spurs by <i>showing that
we did not know half as well what was wanted
as they did</i>. Some of them have acted upon
occasions with me as if they owned the firm
and I was but some airy New Yorker, presuming
to <i>advise upon what I knew very little
about</i>. Well, they are not now interfered with.
<i>They were the true bosses,—the very men we
were looking for.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is this all for the poor boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Every word. Those who have the misfortune
to be rich men’s sons are heavily
weighted in the race. A basketful of bonds
is the heaviest basket a young man ever had to
carry. He generally gets to staggering under
it. The vast majority of rich men’s sons are
unable to resist the temptations to which wealth
subjects them, and they sink to unworthy lives.
It is not from this class that the poor beginner
has rivalry to fear. The partner’s sons will never
trouble you much, but look out that some boys
poorer, much poorer, than yourselves, whose
parents cannot afford to give them any schooling,
do not challenge you at the post and pass
you at the grand stand. Look out for the boy
who has to plunge into work direct from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>common school, and begins by sweeping out
the office. He is the probable dark horse that
will take all the money and win all the applause.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c019'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

vanished fame of his town, is no ordinary person.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Moreover, if such a man has laid his
plans and done his work in the disheartening
eclipse of total blindness, he must possess qualities
of the highest order.</p>

<p class='c011'>The office of the Herreshoff Manufacturing
Company, at Bristol, Rhode Island, is in a
building that formerly belonged to the Burnside
Rifle Company. It is substantial, but unpretentious,
and is entered by a short stairway
on one side. The furniture throughout is also
plain, but has been selected with excellent
taste, and is suggestive of the most effective
adaptation of means to ends in every detail.
On the mantel and on the walls are numerous
pictures, most of them of vessels, but very few
relating directly to any of the great races for
the “America’s” cup. The first picture to
arrest one’s attention, indeed, is an excellent
portrait of the late General Ambrose E. Burnside,
who lived in Bristol, and was an intimate
friend of John B. Herreshoff.</p>

<p class='c011'>Previous inquiry had elicited the information
that the members of the firm are very busy
with various large orders, in addition to the
rush of work on Cup Defenders; so it was a
very agreeable surprise when I was invited into
the tasteful private office, where the blind president
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>sat, having just concluded a short conversation
with an attorney.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“LET THE WORK SHOW”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Well, sir,” said he, rising and grasping my
hand cordially, “what do you wish?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I realize how very busy you must be, Mr.
Herreshoff,” I replied, “and will try to be as
brief as possible; but I venture to ask a few
minutes of your time, to obtain suggestions and
advice from you to young people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why select me, in particular, as an adviser?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was “a poser,” at first, especially when
he added, noting my hesitation:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are frequently requested to give interviews
in regard to our manufacturing business;
but, since as it is the settled policy of our house
to do our work just as well as we possibly can
and then leave it to speak for itself, we have
felt obliged to decline all these requests. It
would be repugnant to our sense of propriety
to talk in public about our special industry.
‘Let the work show!’ seems to us a good
motto.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>THE VOYAGE OF LIFE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“True,” said I. “But the readers of my
books may not care to read of cutters or
‘skimming dishes,’ center-boards or fin keels, or
copper coils <i>versus</i> steel tubes for boilers. They
leave the choice in such matters to you, realizing
that you have always proved equal to the
situation. What I want now is advice in regard
to the race of life,—the voyage in which each
youth must be his own captain, but in which
the words of others who have successfully
sailed the sea before will help to avoid rocks
and shoals, and to profit by favoring currents
and trade winds. You have been handicapped
in an unusual degree, sailing in total darkness
and beset by many other difficulties, but have,
nevertheless, made a very prosperous voyage.
In overcoming such serious obstacles, you must
have learned much of the true philosophy of
both success and failure, and I think you will
be willing to help the young with suggestions
drawn from your experience.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I always want to help young people, or old
people, either, for that matter, if anything I
can say will do so. But what can I say?”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>A MOTHER’S MIGHTY INFLUENCE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“What do you call the prime requisite of
success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall have to answer that by a somewhat
humorous but very shrewd suggestion of another,—select
a good mother. Especially for
boys, I consider an intelligent, affectionate but
considerate mother an almost indispensable
requisite to the highest success. If you would
improve the rising generation to the utmost,
appeal first to the mothers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Above all things else, show them that reasonable
self-denial is a thousandfold better for
a boy than to have his every wish gratified.
Teach them to encourage industry, economy,
concentration of attention and purpose, and indomitable
persistence.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But most mothers try to do this, don’t
they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, in a measure; but many of them, perhaps
most of them, do not emphasize the matter
half enough. A mother may wish to teach
all these lessons to her son, but she thinks too
much of him, or believes she does, to have him
suffer any deprivation, and so indulges him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>things which are luxuries for him, under the
circumstances, rather than necessaries. Many
a boy, born with ordinary intellect, would follow
the example of an industrious father, were
it not that his mother wishes him to appear as
well as any boy in the neighborhood. So, without
exactly meaning it, she gets to making a
show of her boy, and brings him up with a
habit of idling away valuable time, to keep up
appearances. The prudent mother, however,
sees the folly of this course, and teaches her
son to excel in study and work, rather than in
vain display. The difference in mothers makes
all the difference in the world to children, who
like brooks, can be turned very easily in their
course of life.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SELF HELP</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What ranks next in importance?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Boys and girls themselves, especially as
they grow older, and have a chance to understand
what life means, should not only help
their parents as a matter of duty, but should
learn to help themselves, for their own good.
I would not have them forego recreation, a
reasonable amount every day, but let them
learn the reality and earnestness of existence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and resolve to do the whole work and the very
best work of thorough, reliable young men and
women.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>WHAT CAREER</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What would you advise as to choosing a
career?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In that I should be governed largely by
the bent of each youth. What he likes to do
best of all, that he should do; and he should
try to do it better than anyone else. That is
legitimate emulation. Let him devote his full
energy to his work; with the provision, however,
that he needs change or recreation more
in proportion as he uses his brain more. The
more muscular the work, if not too heavy, the
more hours, is a good rule: the more brain
work, the fewer hours. Children at school
should not be expected to work so long or so
hard as if engaged in manual labor. Temperament,
too, should be considered. A highly organized,
nervous person, like a racehorse, may
display intense activity for a short time, but it
should be followed by a long period of rest;
while the phlegmatic person, like the ox or the
draft horse, can go all day without injury.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>EDUCATION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I believe in education most thoroughly, and
think no one can have too much knowledge, if
properly digested. But in many of our colleges,
I have often thought, not more than one
in five is radically improved by the course.
Most collegiates waste too much time in frivolity,
and somehow there seems to be little restraining
power in the college to prevent this.
I agree that students should have self-restraint
and application themselves, but, in the absence
of these, the college should supply more compulsion
than is now the rule.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>APPRENTICES</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Do you favor reviving the old apprentice
system for would-be mechanics?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only in rare cases. As a rule, we have
special machines now that do as perfect work
as the market requires; some of them, indeed,
better work than can be done by hand. A boy
or man can soon learn to tend one of these,
when he becomes, for ordinary purposes, a specialist.
Very few shops now have apprentices.
No rule, however, will apply to all, and it may
still be best for one to serve an apprenticeship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>in a trade in which he wishes to advance beyond
any predecessor or competitor.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>PREPARE TO THE UTMOST: THEN DO YOUR BEST</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Is success dependent more upon ability or
opportunity?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, opportunity is necessary. You
couldn’t run a mammoth department store on
the desert of Sahara. But, given the possibility,
the right man can make his opportunity,
and should do so, if it is not at hand, or does
not come, after reasonable waiting. Even Napoleon
had to wait for his. On the other hand,
if there is no ability, none can display itself,
and the best opportunity must pass by unimproved.
The true way is to first develop your
ability to the last ounce, and then you will be
ready for your opportunity, when it comes, or
to make one, if none offers.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Is the chance for a youth as good as it was
twenty-five or fifty years ago?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and no. In any country, as it becomes
more thickly populated, the chance for
purely individual enterprises is almost sure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>diminish. One notices this more as he travels
through other and older countries, where, far
more than with us, boys follow in the footsteps
of their fathers, generation after generation.
But for those who are willing to adapt
themselves to circumstances, the chance, to-day,
at least from a pecuniary standpoint, is
better than ever before, for those starting in
life. There was doubtless more chance for the
individual boat-builder, in the days of King
Philip, when each Indian made his own canoe;
but there is certainly more profit now for an
employee of our firm of boat-builders.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>NATURAL EXECUTIVE ABILITY</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Granted, however, that he can find employment,
how do his chances of rising compare
with those of your youth?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They still depend largely upon the individual.
<i>Some seem to have natural executive
ability, and others develop it, while most men
never possess it. Those who lack it cannot
hope to rise far, and never could.</i> Jefferson’s
idea that all men are created equal is true
enough, perhaps, so far as their political rights
are concerned, but from the point of view of
efficiency in business, it is ridiculous. In any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>shop of one hundred men, you will find one
who is acknowledged, at least tacitly, as the
leader, and he sooner or later becomes so in
fact. A rich boy may get and hold a place in
an office, on account of his wealth or influence;
but in the works, merit alone will enable a man
to hold a place long.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE DEVELOPMENT OF POWER</h3>

<p class='c016'>“But what is his chance of becoming a proprietor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is smaller, of course, as establishments
grow larger and more valuable. It is all
bosh for every man to expect to become a Vanderbilt
or a Rockefeller, or to be President.
But, in the long run, a man will still rise and
prosper in almost exact proportion to his real
value to the business world. He will rise or fall
according to his ability.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can he develop ability?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, to a certain extent. As I have said,
we are not all alike, and no amount of cultivation
will make some minds equal to those of
others who have had but little training. But,
whether great or small, everyone has some
weak point; let him first study to overcome
that.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“How can he do it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The only way I know of is to—do it. But
this brings me back to what I told you at first.
A good mother will show one how to guard
against his weak points. She should study
each child and develop his individual character,
for character is the true foundation, after all.
She should check extravagance and encourage
industry and self-respect. My mother is one
of the best, and I feel I owe her a debt I can
never repay.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“MY MOTHER”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Your mother? Why, I thought you had
been a boat-builder for half a century! How
old is she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is eighty-eight, and still enjoys good
health. If I have one thing more than another
to be thankful for, it is her care in childhood
and her advice and sympathy through life.
How often have I thought of her wisdom when
I have seen mothers from Europe (where they
were satisfied to be peasants), seek to outshine
all their neighbors after they have been in
America a few years, and so bring financial
ruin to their husbands or even goad them into
crime, and curse their children with contempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>for honest labor in positions for which they are
fitted, and a foolish desire to keep up appearances,
even by living beyond their means and
by seeking positions they cannot fill properly.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A BOAT-BUILDER IN YOUTH</h3>

<p class='c016'>“You must have been quite young, when
you began to build boats?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About thirteen or fourteen years old. You
see, my father was an amateur boat-builder, in
a small way, and did very good work, but usually
not for sale. But I began the work as a
business thirty-six years ago, when I was about
twenty-two.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HE WOULD NOT BE DISCOURAGED</h3>

<p class='c016'>“You must have been terribly handicapped
by your blindness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was an obstacle, but I simply would not
allow it to discourage me, and did my best, just
the same as if I could see. My mother had
taught me to think, and so I made thought and
memory take the place of eyes. I acquired a
kind of habit of mental projection which has
enabled me to see models in my mind, as it
were, and to consider their good and bad points
intelligently. Besides, I cultivated my powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>of observation to the utmost, in other respects.
Even now, I take an occasional trip of observation,
for I like to see what others are doing,
and so keep abreast of the progress of the age.
But I must stop or I shall get to ‘talking shop,’
the thing I declined to do at first.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE SUM OF IT ALL</h3>

<p class='c016'>“The main thing for a boy is to have a good
mother, to heed her advice, to do his best, and
not get a ‘swelled head’ as he rises,—in other
words, not to expect to put a gallon into a pint
cup, or a bushel into a peck measure. Concentration,
decision, industry and economy should
be his watchwords, and invincible determination
and persistence his rule of action.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With another cordial handshake, he bade me
good-by.</p>

    <div>WHAT THE HERRESHOFF BROTHERS HAVE BEEN DOING</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Their recent Cup Defenders have made their
names familiar to all, but shipping circles have
long known them. The business of the firm
was long confined almost wholly to the creation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of boats with single masts, each craft from
twenty to thirty-six feet long. In their first ten
years of associated work, they built nearly two
thousand of these. But they were wonderful
little boats, and of unrivaled swiftness. Then
they made as wonderful a success in building
steam fishing yachts. Then came torpedo boats.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i290fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><i>The race between the “Vigilant” and the “Valkyrie.”</i><br />(<i>The “Vigilant,” Herreshoff boat, the winner.</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And in 1881 their proposal to the British
government to build two vedette boats was accepted
on condition they should outmatch the
work of White, the naval launch builder at
Cowes. No firm had ever been able to compete
with White. But in the following July
the two Herreshoff boats were in the Portsmouth
dockyard, England, ready for trial.
They were each forty-eight feet long, nine feet
in beam, and five feet deep, exactly the same
size as White’s. They made fifteen and one-half
knots an hour, while White’s only recorded
twelve and two-fifths knots. “With
all their machinery coal and water in place,
the Herreshoff boats were filled with water,
and then twenty men were put aboard each,
that human load being just so much in excess
the admiralty test, and even then each had a
floating capacity of three tons. The examiners
pronounced enthusiastically in favor of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Herreshoff safety coil boilers as unexplodable,
less liable to injury from shock, capable of raising
steam more quickly, far lighter, and in all
respects superior to those that had been formerly
used for the purpose.” The boats were accepted,
and orders given at once for two pinnaces,
each thirty-three feet long. Again John
Samuel White competed, but his new boats
could only make seven and one-eighth knots,
while the Herreshoff’s easily scored nine and
one-quarter.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>RACING JAY GOULD</h3>

<p class='c016'>In July, 1883, Jay Gould was highly elated
over the speed of his beautiful steam yacht
“Atalanta,” which had several times met and
distanced Edward S. Jaffray’s wonderful
“Stranger;” but, on the twentieth of that
month, his happiness, as the story is told, was
very suddenly dashed.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a hard day’s work, the jaded Jay
boarded the “Atalanta” and began to shake
out his pin-feathers a little, figuratively speaking.
But before his boat had gone far on her
run to Irvington, the bold manipulator of Wall
Street made out a craft on his weather-quarter
that seemed to be gliding after the “Atalanta”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>with intent to overhaul her. He had a good
start, however, and sang out to the captain to
keep a sharp eye on the persistent little
stranger, so unlike the “Stranger” he had
vanquished.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder what it is!” he exclaimed to a
friend beside him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The friend looked long and carefully at the
oncoming boat, then turned a quizzical eye on
Jay, remarking:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a little while we can tell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will she get that close?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think she will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not long before the strange boat was
abreast of the “Atalanta,” and Jay was then
able to make out the mystical number “100”
on her. He rubbed his eyes. Those were the
very figures he had long hoped to see on the
stock ticker, after the words “Western
Union,” but that day they had lost their charm.
Before long he was not only able to see the
broadside of the “100,” but also had a good
view of the stern of the vessel, whereon the
same figures soon appeared and nearly as soon
disappeared, as the “100” bade good-by to the
“Atalanta,” which was burning every pound
of coal that could possibly be carried without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>putting Mr. Gould or some efficient substitute
on the safety valve.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He seems to be out of humor to-night,”
said his coachman, after leaving his employer
at the door of his Irvington mansion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mystic “100” which, by the way, was
just one hundred feet over all, was merely the
hundredth steamer built by the Herreshoffs,
but on her first trip up the Hudson she attracted
as much attention as the “Half Moon”
of Henry Hudson or the “Clermont” of Robert
Fulton. She was the fastest yacht in the
world, and was beaten on the river by only one
vessel, the “Mary Powell”—four and one-half
minutes in twenty miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although Mr. Gould was considerably irritated
at his defeat, he knew a good thing when
he saw it, and the next year he ordered a small
steam launch of the Herreshoffs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “100” made a great stir in Boston
Harbor. Later on she steamed through the
Erie canal and the Great Lakes, and made her
home with the millionaire Mark Hopkins.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE “STILETTO”</h3>

<p class='c016'>The versatility of the Herreshoffs has appeared
in their famous boiler improvement, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>in the great variety of vessels they have built.
The “Stiletto” only ninety-four feet long,
over all, astonished the yachting world in 1885.
On June 10, she beat the “Mary Powell” two
miles in a race of twenty-eight miles on the
Hudson. At one time, the “Stiletto” circled
completely around the big steamer and then
moved rapidly away from her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secretary Whitney bought the “Stiletto”
for the United States navy, in which she has
done valuable service. She was followed, in
1890, by the still faster “Cushing,” whose record
in the recent Spanish-American war is so
well known.</p>

<p class='c011'>Admiral Porter wrote to Secretary of the
Navy Chandler, that the little Herreshoff
steam launches were faster than any other
owned by the government, their great superiority
showing especially against a strong head
wind and sea, when they would remain dry
while their rivals required constant bailing.
They were better trimmed, lighter, more buoyant,
and in every way superior in nautical qualities,
and twice as fast as others in a gale.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nineteen vessels have been built by this firm
for the United States government.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a certain speed that attaches to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>every vessel, which may be called its natural
rate,” says Lewis Herreshoff; “it is mainly
governed by its length and the length of the
carrier wave which always accompanies a vessel
parallel to her line of motion. When she
reaches a speed great enough to form a wave of
the same length as the moving body, then that
vessel has reached her natural rate of speed,
and all that can be obtained above that is done
by sheer brute force. The natural limit of speed
of a boat forty feet long is about ten miles an
hour; of a vessel sixty feet in length, twelve
and one-quarter miles; of one a hundred feet
long, fifteen and three-fourths miles; of one
two hundred feet long, twenty-two miles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the speed is increased, this double or carrier
wave, one-half on either side of the yacht,
lengthens in such a way that the vessel seems
to settle more the faster she goes, and so has
to climb the very wave she makes. Hence the
motive power must be increased much faster
than the speed increases. Further, in order to
avoid this settling and consequent climbing as
much as possible, lightness of construction,
next to correct proportions, is made the great
desideratum in the Herreshoffs’ ideal boat.
They use wood wherever possible, as it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>only lighter than metal, but is reasonably strong
and generally much more durable. Wherever
heavy strains come, a bracing form of construction
is adopted, and metal is used also.</p>

<p class='c011'>The engine of the “Stiletto” weighs ten
pounds for each indicated horse-power; that
of the “Cushing,” fifteen. The entire motive
plant of the “Cushing” weighs sixty-five
pounds for each horse-power; that of the “City
of Paris,” two hundred. Comparing displacement,
the former has eight times the power of
the latter.</p>

<p class='c011'>For four years our government kept a staff
of officers stationed at the Herreshoff works to
experiment with high-speed machinery, in
which the firm then led the country. One of
their steamers, ascending the St. Lawrence
River to the Thousand Islands, ran up all the
rapids except the Lachine, where a detour by
canal was made. The Canadians were deeply
impressed by this triumph.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE BLIND BROTHERS</h3>

<p class='c016'>One of the Herreshoff sisters is blind and a
remarkable musician; and one brother blind
who studied music in Berlin, and who conducts
a school of music in Providence. Lewis Herreshoff,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>one of the boat-builders, is also blind.
He, too, is a fine musician and an excellent
bass singer, having received careful vocal training
in Europe. He has fine literary taste, a
very clear style, and writes for magazines,
especially on boat-building and engineering.
He has a large foreign correspondence, all of
which he answers personally on the typewriter.
It would be difficult to find a greater favorite
with young people, to whom he devotes much
of his time, teaching them games or lessons,
also how to sail or row a boat, how to swim or
float, and how to save each other from drowning.
When walking along the street with a
group of chatting children, he will ask, “What
time is it by the clock on St. Michael’s
Church?” pointing right at the steeple. He
will wind a clock and set it exactly, and regulate
it, if it does not go right.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE PERSONALITY OF JOHN B. HERRESHOFF</h3>

<p class='c016'>From his boyhood, John B. Herreshoff
evinced a great fondness for boats and machinery,
finding most pleasure, in his leisure hours,
when boys of his age usually think only of play,
in haunting boat-builders’ yards and machine
shops, studying how and why things were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>done, and reading what had been done elsewhere
in those branches of industry, beyond his
field of observation.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the age of eleven, he was studying the
best lines for vessels’ hulls and making models
and three years later he began building boats.</p>

<p class='c011'>His terrible affliction has never seemed to
weaken his self-reliance or turn him aside from
following the chosen pursuit of his life, but has
rather strengthened his devotion to it and his
capacity for it by concentrating all his faculties
upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>His many years of blindness have given him
not only the serious, patient, introspective look
common to those who suffer like him, and their
gentle, clearly modulated voice, but have also
developed all his other faculties to such an extent
as to largely replace the missing sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>He can tell as much about an ordinary-sized
steam launch, her lines, methods of construction,
etc., by feeling, as others can by seeing,
and he goes on inventing and building just as if
his eyes were not closed forever. He is a tall,
big-brained man, who couldn’t help inventing
and working if he tried. Such a man would
have to suffer the loss of more than one of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>senses before his mental efficiency would be
impaired. When he wanted to build some
steam launches for the government, he went
to the navy yard at Washington and felt of the
government launches, to discover their shape
and how they were made. Then he went to
Bristol and made better launches suitable for
the government’s use.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>HAS HE A SIXTH SENSE?</h3>

<p class='c016'>He reads and understands the most delicate
intonations and modulations of voices addressing
him, as others read and understand facial
expression. His sensitive fingers detect differences
in metals, and follow, as if with a gift
of perception, the lines of models submitted to
him, and his mind sees even more clearly than by
mere physical sight the intricacies of the most
complicated machinery intelligently described
to him, or over which his fingers are allowed to
move. “That is a good stick,” he will say, examining
a pile of lumber with his fingers.
“Here’s a shaky piece, throw it out; it won’t
do for this work,” may come next, or, “Saw
off this end; it’s poor stock. The rest is all
right.” On hearing him criticize, direct, and
explain things within his province, a stranger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>finds it hard to believe he cannot see at least a
little,—out of one eye.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>SEEING WITH THE FINGERS</h3>

<p class='c016'>By the constant practice, he has, as he expresses
it, learned to see with his hands, not
quite so quickly, but he believes as perfectly, as
he could with his eyes, and this means more
than it does in the case of an ordinary blind
man; for, by a touch, he can tell whether the
graceful double curves of a boat’s bottom are
in correct proportion, one with another, and
then, by a few rapid sweeps of his hands, over
all, he can instantly judge of the symmetry
and perfection of the whole. Even more than
this, he will give minute directions to the carpenters
and mechanics, running his hand along
the piece of work one had produced, will immediately
detect the slightest deviation from
the instruction he has given. If at all impatient,
he will seize the plane or other tool, and
do the work himself. And yet the world calls
this man “blind!”</p>

<p class='c011'>While skill plays a material part, one of John
B. Herreshoff’s boats is a product of the mind,
in a very great degree. Psychologists tell us
that we do not see with our eyes, but with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>brain proper. This blind man sees, and constructs,
not that which is objective and real to
others, but that which is evolved from a transcendental
intelligence applied to the most practical
purposes.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>BROTHER NAT</h3>

<p class='c016'>One of the brothers, who has good eyes, is
a prominent chemist in New York; and one
who can see is Nat the designer for the boat-building.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nathaniel G., the great yacht designer, was
born in 1848. When he was not more than two
years old, he was often found asleep on the
sand along shore, with the rising tide washing
his bare feet. Whenever he was missing, he
was sought for first on the shore, where he
would generally be found watching the ships or
playing with toy boats.</p>

<p class='c011'>At nine years of age, he was an excellent
helmsman, and at twelve he sailed the
“Sprite” to her first victory and won a prize.
When older grown, he was known as a vigilant
watcher of every chance as well as a skillful
sailor. Once, when steering the “Ianthe” in
a failing wind, he veered widely from a crowd
of contestants, so as to run into a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>breeze he noted far to starboard, and won
the race.</p>

<p class='c011'>He took a four years’ course at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and then
served an apprenticeship with the famous Corliss
Engine Company. He worked on the great
engine at the Centennial Exposition, and took
a course of engineering abroad, visiting many
noted shipyards. He joined the firm in 1877,
fourteen years after the works were opened.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nathaniel Greene Herreshoff, named for
General Greene of Revolutionary fame, is seven
years younger, and only less famous than his
blind brother as a boat-builder,—only second
to John B. in about the same way that Greene
was second to Washington. “General Greene
is second to no one,” said Washington. John
B. would have done splendid work without Nat
as he did for years before the latter joined the
firm, but it would have been in a smaller way.</p>

<p class='c011'>For years John B., his father, and his brothers,
James B. or Lewis, and Nathaniel G., were
accustomed to get together frequently in the
dining-room of the old homestead, and talk and
plan together in regard to boat-building. Nat
would usually make the first model on lines
previously agreed upon, and then John B.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>would feel it over and suggest changes, which
would be made, and the consultation continued
until all was satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nathaniel is described as “a tall, thin man,
with a full beard and a stoop,” the latter said
to have been acquired in “watching his rivals
in his races, craning his head in order to see
them from under the boom.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have been always together from boyhood,”
said John B., speaking of “Nat;”
“we have had the same pleasures, the same
purposes, the same aspirations; in fact, we
have almost been one, and we have achieved
nothing for which a full share of credit is not
his just due. Nothing has ever been done by
one without the other. Whenever one found
an obstacle or difficulty, the other helped him to
remove it; and he, being without the disadvantage
I have, never makes a mistake.”</p>

    <div>Practical Hints to Young Authors,</div>
    <div class='c000'>BY MRS. AMELIA E. BARR</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c018'>TO be successful! That is the legitimate
ideal every true worker seeks to realize.
But success is not the open secret
which it appears to be; its elements are
often uncomprehended; and its roots generally
go deep down, into the very beginnings of life.
I can compel my soul to look back into that
twilight which shrouds my earliest years, and
perceive, even in them, monitions and tendencies
working for that future, which in my destiny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>was fashioned and shaped when as yet
there was neither hint nor dream of it. Fortunately,
I had parents who understood the</p>
<h3 class='c015'>VALUE OF BIBLICAL AND IMAGINATIVE LITERATURE</h3>
<p class='c017'>in the formation of the intellect. The men and
women whom I knew first and best were those
of the Hebrew world. Sitting before the
nursery fire, while the snow fell softly and
ceaselessly, and all the mountains round were
white, and the streets of the little English town
choked with drifts, I could see the camels and
the caravans of the Ishmaelitish merchants,
passing through the hot, sandy desert. I could
see Hagar weeping under the palm, and the
waters of the Red Sea standing up like a wall.
Miriam clashing the timbrels, and Deborah
singing under the oak, and Ruth gleaning in
the wheatfields of Bethlehem, were as real to
me as were the women of my own home. Before
I was six years old, I had been with Christian
to the Celestial City, and had watched,
with Crusoe, the mysterious footprint on the
sand, and the advent of the savages. Then
came the wonders of afrites and genii, and all
the marvels and miracles of the Arabian tales.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>These were the mind-builders, and though
schools and teachers and text-books did much
afterwards, I can never nor will forget the
glorious company of men and women from the
sacred world, and that marvelous company of
caliphs and kings and princesses from Wonder
Land and Fairy Land, that expanded my whole
nature, and fitted me for the future miracles of
Nature and Science, and all the marvelous people
of the Poet’s realm.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f8'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is a most remarkable story, communicated to
me by Mrs. Barr, and related for the first time in this
article. The distinguished novelist, being a perfect
housekeeper and the mother of a large family, yet earns
$20,000 a year by her books, which have been translated
into the language of almost every civilized country.—O. S. M.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For eighteen years I was amassing facts and
fancies, developing a crude intelligence, waiting
for the vitalization of the heart. Then
Love, the Supreme Teacher, came; and his
first lesson was,</p>
<h3 class='c015'>RENUNCIATION.</h3>
<p class='c017'>I was to give up father, and mother, home and
kindred, friends and country, and follow where
he would lead me, into a land strange and far
off. Child-bearing and child-losing; the limitations
and delights of frontier life; the intimate
society of such great and individual men
as Sam Houston, and the men who fought with
him; the intense feelings induced by war, its
uncertainties and possibilities, and the awful
abiding in the Valley of the Shadow of Death,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>with the pestilence that walked in darkness and
the sickness that destroyed at noonday;—all
these events with their inevitable “asides”
were instrumental in the education and preparation
of the seventeen years of my married
life.</p>
<p class='c011'>The calamitous lesson of widowhood, under
peculiarly tragic circumstances, was the last
initiation of a heart already broken and humbled
before Him who doeth all things well, no
matter how hard the stroke may be. I thought
all was over then; yet all was just beginning.
It was the open door to a new life—a life full
of comforts, and serene, still,</p>
<h3 class='c015'>DELIGHTFUL STUDIES.</h3>
<p class='c017'>Though I had written stories to please my
children, and many things to please myself, it
had never occurred to me that money could be
made by writing. The late William Libbey,
a man of singular wisdom and kindness, first
made me understand that my brain and my
ten fingers were security for a good living.
From my first effort I began to gather in the
harvest of all my years of study and reading
and private writing. For there is this peculiarity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>about writing—that if in any direction
it has merit, it will certainly find a market.</p>
<p class='c011'>For fifteen years I wrote short stories,
poems, editorials, and articles on every conceivable
subject, from Herbert Spencer’s theories,
to gentlemen’s walking sticks; but bringing
to every piece of work, if it was only ten
lines, the best of my knowledge and ability;
and so earning, with a great deal of pleasure,
a very good living. During the earlier years
of this time I worked and read on an average</p>
<h3 class='c015'>FIFTEEN HOURS A DAY;</h3>
<p class='c017'>for I knew that, to make good work, I must
have constant fresh material; must keep up
to date in style and method; and must therefore
<i>read</i> far more than I wrote. But I have
been an omnivorous reader all my life long,
and no changes, no cares of home and children,
have ever interfered with this mental necessity.
In the most unlikely places and circumstances,
I looked for books, and found them. These
fifteen years on the weekly and monthly periodicals
gave me the widest opportunities for
information. I had an alcove in the Astor
Library, and I practically lived in it. I slept
and ate at home, but I lived in that City of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Books. I was in the prime of life, but neither
society, amusements, nor pleasures of any kind,
could draw me away from the source of all my
happiness and profit.</p>
<p class='c011'>Suddenly, after this long novition, I received
the “call” for a different work. I had</p>
<h3 class='c015'>AN ACCIDENT</h3>
<p class='c017'>which confined me to my room, and which, I
knew, would keep me from active work for
some months. I fretted for my work, as dry
wood frets an inch from the flame, and said,
“I shall lose all I have gained; I shall fall behind
in the race; all these things are against
me.” They were all for me. A little story
of what seemed exceptional merit, had been
laid away, in the hope that I might some day
find time to extend it into a novel. A prisoner
in my chair, I finished the book in six weeks,
and sent it to Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. On Thanksgiving
morning, a letter came, accepting the
book, and any of my readers can imagine what
a happy Thanksgiving Day that was! This
book was “Jan Vedder’s Wife,” and its great
and immediate success indicated to me the work
I was at length ready for. I was then in my
fifty-second year, and every year had been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>preparation for the work I have since pursued.
I went out from that sick room sure of my</p>
<h3 class='c015'>VOCATION;</h3>
<p class='c017'>and, with a confidence founded on the certainty
of my equipment, and a determination to trust
humanity, and take my readers only into green
pastures and ways of purity and heroism, I
ventured on my new path as a novelist.</p>
<p class='c011'>I cannot close this paper without a few
words to those who wish to profit by it. I
want them to be sure of a few points which, in
my narrative, I may not have emphasized sufficiently.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>WORDS OF COUNSEL</h3>

<p class='c016'>1. Men and women succeed <i>because they
take pains to succeed</i>. Industry and patience
are almost genius; and successful people are
often more distinguished for resolution and
perseverance than for unusual gifts. They
make determination and unity of purpose supply
the place of ability.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Success is the reward of those who
“spurn delights and live laborious days.” We
learn to do things by <i>doing them. One of the
great secrets of success is “pegging away.”</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>No disappointment must discourage, and a run
back must often be allowed, in order to take a
longer leap forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. <i>No opposition must be taken to heart.</i>
Our enemies often help us more than our
friends. Besides, a head-wind is better than
no wind. Who ever got anywhere in a dead
calm?</p>

<p class='c011'>4. <i>A fatal mistake is to imagine that success
is some stroke of luck.</i> This world is run
with far too tight a rein for luck to interfere.
Fortune <i>sells</i> her wares; she never gives them.
In some form or other, we pay for her favors;
or we go empty away.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. We have been told, for centuries, to
watch for opportunities, and to strike while the
iron is hot. Very good; but I think better of
Oliver Cromwell’s amendment.—“<i>make the
iron hot by striking it.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>6. Everything good needs time. Don’t do
work in a hurry. Go into details; it pays in
every way. <i>Time means power for your work.</i>
Mediocrity is always in a rush; but whatever
is worth doing at all is worth doing with consideration.
For genius is nothing more nor
less than doing well what anyone can do badly.</p>

<p class='c011'>7. <i>Be orderly.</i> Slatternly work is never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>good work. It is either affectation, or there is
some radical defect in the intellect. I would
distrust even the spiritual life of one whose
methods and work were dirty, untidy, and
without clearness and order.</p>

<p class='c011'>8. Never be above your profession. I have
had many letters from people who wanted all
the emoluments and honors of literature, and
who yet said, “Literature is the accident of
my life; I am a lawyer, or a doctor, or a lady,
or a gentleman.” <i>Literature is no accident.
She is a mistress who demands the whole heart,
the whole intellect, and the whole time of a
devotee.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>9. Don’t fail through defects of temper and
over-sensitiveness at moments of trial. <i>One
of the great helps to success is to be cheerful</i>;
to go to work with a full sense of life; to be
determined to put hindrances out of the way;
to prevail over them and to get the mastery.
<i>Above all things else, be cheerful</i>; there is no
beatitude for the despairing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Apparent success may be reached by sheer
impudence, in defiance of offensive demerit.
But men who get what they are manifestly
unfit for, are made to feel what people think of
them. Charlatanry may flourish; but when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>its bay tree is greenest, it is held far lower than
genuine effort. The world is just; it may, it
does, patronize quacks; but <i>it never puts them
on a level with true men</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is better to have the opportunity of victory,
than to be spared the struggle; for success
comes but as the result of arduous experience.
The foundations of my success were laid
before I can well remember; <i>it was after at
least forty-five years of conscious labor that I
reached the object of my hope</i>. Many a time
my head failed me, my hands failed me, my
feet failed me, but, thank God, my <i>heart</i> never
failed me. Because <i>I knew that no extremity
would find God’s arm shortened</i>.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>How Theodore Thomas Brought the People Nearer to Music</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>MR. THOMAS is an early riser, and as
I found him one morning, in his
chambers in Chicago, he was preparing
to leave for rehearsal. The hale old
gentleman actively paced the floor, while I conversed
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Thomas,” I said, “those familiar with
the events of your life consider them a lesson
of encouragement for earnest and high-minded
artists.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is kind,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like, if you will, to have you
speak of your work in building up your great
orchestra in this country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is too long a story. I would have to
begin with my birth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where were you born?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“In the kingdom of Hanover, in 1835. My
father was a violinist, and from him I inherited
my taste, I suppose. He taught me music.
When I was only six years old, I played the
violin at public concerts.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>“I WAS NOT AN INFANT PRODIGY”</h3>

<p class='c016'>“I was not an infant prodigy, however. My
father had too much wisdom to injure my
chances in that way. He made me keep to my
studies in a manner that did me good. I came
to America in 1845.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was the American music field crowded
then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the contrary, there wasn’t any field to
speak of. It had to be made. Music was the
pastime of a few. The well-educated and fashionable
classes possessed or claimed a knowledge
of it. There was scarcely any music for
the common people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you get your start in the New
York world of music?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“With four associates, William Mason, Joseph
Mosenthal, George Matzka and Frederick
Berguer, I began a series of concerts of Chamber
Music, and for many years we conducted
this modest artistic enterprise. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>much musical enthusiasm on our part, but very
little reward, except the pleasure we drew from
our own playing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These Mason and Thomas <i>soirées</i> are still
remembered by old-time music lovers of New
York, not only for their excellence, but for the
peculiar character of the audiences. They
were quiet little monthly reunions, to which
most of the guests came with complimentary
tickets. The critics hardly ventured to intrude
upon the exercises, and the newspapers gave
them little notice.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>BEGINNING OF THE ORCHESTRA</h3>

<p class='c016'>“How did you come to found your great orchestra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was more of a growth than a full-fledged
thought to begin with. It was in 1861
that I severed my connection with the opera
and began to establish a genuine orchestra. I
began with occasional performances, popular
matinée concerts, and so on, and, in a few
years, was able to give a series of Symphony
<i>Soirées</i> at the old Irving Hall in New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To the average person this work of Mr.
Thomas may seem to be neither difficult nor
great. Yet while anyone could have collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>a band in a week, to make such an orchestra as
Mr. Thomas meant to have, required time and
patience. It was when the Philharmonic Society,
after living through a great many hardships,
was on the full tide of popular favor.
Its concerts and rehearsals filled the
Academy of Music with the flower of New
York society. Powerful social influences had
been won to its support, and Carl Bergmann
had raised its noble orchestra of one hundred
performers to a point of proficiency then quite
unexampled in this country, and in some particulars
still unsurpassed. Ladies and gentlemen
who moved in the best circles hardly noticed
the parallel entertainment offered in such
a modest way, by Mr. Thomas, on the opposite
side of the street. The patrons of his Chamber
Concerts, of course, went in to see what the
new orchestra was like; professional musicians
hurried to the hall with their free passes; and
there were a few curious listeners besides who
found in the programmes a class of compositions
somewhat different from those which Mr.
Bergmann chiefly favored, and, in particular, a
freshness and novelty in the selections, with an
inclination, not yet very strongly marked, toward
the modern German school. Among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>such of the <i>dilettanti</i> as condescended to think
of Mr. Thomas at all, there was a vague impression
that his concerts were started in opposition
to the Philharmonic Society, but that
they were not so good and much less genteel.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is true that Mr. Thomas was surpassed,
at that time, by Mr. Bergmann’s larger and
older orchestra, and that he had much less than
an equal share of public favor, but there was no
intentional rivalry. The two men had entirely
different ideas and worked them out in perfectly
original ways. It was only the artist’s
dismal period of struggle and neglect, which
every beginner must pass through. He had to
meet cold and meager audiences, and the false
judgment of both the critics and the people.
Yet he was a singular compound of good
American energy and German obstinacy, and
he never lost courage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was it a long struggle?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not very long. Matters soon began to
mend. The orchestra improved, the dreadful
gaps in the audience soon filled up, and at the
end of the year the Symphony <i>Soirées</i>, if they
made no excitement in musical circles, had at
least achieved a high reputation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was your aim, at that time?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>“When I began, I was convinced that there
is no music too high for the popular appreciation,—that
no scientific education is required
for the enjoyment of Beethoven. I believed
that it is only necessary that a public whose
taste has been vitiated by over-indulgence in
trifles, should have time and opportunity to accustom
itself to better things. The American
people at large then (1864) knew little or
nothing of the great composers for the orchestra.
Three or four more or less complete organizations
had visited the principal cities of
the United States in former years, but they
made little permanent impression. Juillien had
brought over, for his monster concerts, only five
or six solo players, and the band was filled up
with such material as he found here. The celebrated
Germania Band of New York, which
had first brought Mr. Bergmann (famous then
as the head of the New York Philharmonic Society)
into notice, did some admirable work
just previous to my start in New York, but it
disbanded after six years of vicissitude, and,
besides, it was not a complete orchestra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean,” I said, as Mr. Thomas paused
meditatively, “that you came at a time when
there was a decided opportunity?”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>MUSIC HAD NO HOLD ON THE MASSES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Yes. There had been, and were then, good
organizations, such as the New York Philharmonic
Society and the Harvard Musical Association
in Boston, and a few similar organizations
in various parts of the country. I mean
no disparagement to their honorable labors,
but, in simple truth, none of them had great influence
on the masses. They were pioneers of
culture. They prepared the way for the modern
permanent orchestra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were not important?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no; that cannot be said. It would be
the grossest ingratitude to forget what they
did and have done and are still doing, or detract
in the smallest degree from their well-earned
fame. But from the very nature of their
organization, it was inevitable that they
should stand a little apart from the common
crowd. To the general public, their performances
were more like mysterious rites, celebrated
behind closed doors, in the presence of
a select and unchanging company of believers.
Year after year, the same twenty-five hundred
people filled the New York Academy of Music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>at the Philharmonic concerts, applauding the
same class of master works, and growing more
and more familiar with the same standards of
the strictly classical school. This was no cause
for complaint; on the contrary, it was most
fortunate that the reverence for the older forms
of art and canons of taste were thus kept alive;
and we know that, little by little, the culture
which the Philharmonic Society diffuses,
through the circle of its regular subscribers,
spreads beyond that small company, and raises
the æsthetic tone of metropolitan life. But I
believed then, as I believe now, that it would
require generations for this little leaven to
leaven the whole mass, and so I undertook to
do my part in improving matters by forming
an orchestra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You wanted to get nearer the people with
good music?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I wanted the people to get nearer to
music. I was satisfied that the right course is
to begin at the bottom instead of the top, and
make the cultivation of symphonic music a
popular movement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was the idea of a popular permanent orchestra
new at that time?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why was it necessary to effect a permanent
orchestra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why? Because the first step in making
music popular was to raise the standard of orchestral
performances and increase their frequency.
Our country had never possessed a
genuine orchestra, for a band of players gathered
together at rare intervals for a special
purpose does not deserve the name. The musician
who marches at the head of a target
company all the morning and plays for a dancing
party at night, is out of tune with the great
masters. To express the deep emotions of
Beethoven, the romanticism of Schumann, or
the poetry of Liszt, he ought to live in an atmosphere
of art, and keep not only his hand in
practice, but his mind properly attempered. An
orchestra, therefore, ought to be a permanent
body, whose members play together every day,
under the same conductor, and devote themselves
exclusively to genuine music. Nobody
had yet attempted to found an orchestra of this
kind in America when I began; but I believed
it could be done.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>WORKING OUT HIS IDEA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Did you have an idea of a permanent building
for your orchestra?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. I wanted something more than an
ordinary concert-room. The idea needed it. It
was to be a place suitable for use at all seasons
of the year. There was to be communication in
summer with an open garden, and in winter
it was to be a perfect auditorium.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Thomas’s idea went even further. It
must be bright, comfortable, roomy, well ventilated—for
a close and drowsy atmosphere is
fatal to symphonic music,—it must offer to the
multitude every attraction not inconsistent with
musical enjoyment. The stage must be adapted
for a variety of performances, for popular summer
entertainment as well as the most serious
of classical concerts. There, with an uninterrupted
course of entertainments, night after
night, the whole year round, the noblest work
of all the great masters might be worthily
presented.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scheme was never wholly worked out in
New York, great as Mr. Thomas’s fame became,
but it was partially realized in the old
Exposition building in Chicago, where he afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>gave his summer concerts, and it is
still nearer reality in the present permanent
Chicago orchestra, which has the great Auditorium
for its home and a $50,000 annual
guarantee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What were your first steps in this direction?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I began with a series of <i>al fresco</i> entertainments
in the old Terrace Garden, in June, 1866.
They were well patronized; and repeated in
1867. Then, in 1868, we removed to better
quarters in Central Park Garden, and things
prospered, so that, in 1869, I began those annual
tours, which are now so common.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The first itinerary of this kind was not very
profitable, but the young conductor fought
through it. Each new season improved somewhat,
but there were troubles and losses. More
than once, the travelers trod close upon the
heels of calamity. The cost of moving from
place to place was so great that the most careful
management was necessary to cover expenses.
They could not afford to be idle, even
for a night, and the towns capable of furnishing
good audiences generally wanted fun.
Hence they must travel all day, and Thomas
took care that the road should be smoothed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>with all obtainable comforts. Special cars on
the railways, special attendants to look after
the luggage, and lodgings at the best hotels
contributed to make the tour tolerably pleasant
and easy, so that the men came to their evening
work fresh and smiling. They were tied up by
freshets and delayed by wrecks; but their fame
grew, and the audiences became greater.
Thomas’s fame as a conductor who could guarantee
constant employment permitted him to
take his choice of the best players in the country,
and he brought over a number of European
celebrities as the public taste improved.</p>

<p class='c011'>Theodore Thomas did another wise thing.
He treated New York like a provincial city,
giving it a week of music once in a while as he
passed through it on his travels. This excited
the popular interest, and when he came to stay,
the next season, a brilliantly successful series of
concerts was the result. At the close, a number
of his admirers united in presenting him a rich
silver casket, holding a purse of thirty-five hundred
dollars, as a testimonial of gratitude for
his services. The Brooklyn Philharmonic Society
placed itself under his direction. Chicago
gave him a fine invitation to attend benefit entertainments
to himself; and, when he came,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>decked the hall with abundant natural flowers,
as if for the reception of a hero. He was successful
financially and every other way, and
from that time on he merely added to his
laurels.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THE CHIEF ELEMENT OF HIS SUCCESS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“What,” I asked of him, “do you consider
the chief element of your success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is difficult to say. Perseverance,
hard work, stern discipline,—each had its
part.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have never attempted to become
rich?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poh!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you still believe in the best music for
the mass of the people?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do. My success has been with them. It
was so in New York; it is so here in Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you still work as hard as ever?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nearly so. The training of a large orchestra
never ends. The work must be gone over
and over. There is always something new.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your life’s pleasure lies in this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wholly so. To render perfect music perfectly—that
is enough.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>John Burroughs at Home: The Hut on the Hill Top</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>WHEN I visited the hill-top retreat of
John Burroughs, the distinguished
writer upon nature, at West Park,
New York, it was with the feeling that all success
is not material; that mere dollars are nothing,
and that the influential man is the successful
man, whether he be rich or poor. John Burroughs
is unquestionably both influential and
poor. Relatively poor: being an owner of some
real estate, and having a modest income from
copyrights. He is content: knowing when he
has enough. On the wooden porch of his little
bark-covered cabin I waited, one June afternoon,
until he should come back from the
woods and fields, where he had gone for a ramble.
It was so still that the sound of my rocker
moving to and fro on the rough boards of the
little porch seemed to shock the perfect quiet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>From afar off came the plaintive cry of a wood-dove,
and then all was still again. Presently
the interpreter of out-door life appeared in the
distance, and, seeing a stranger at his door,
hurried homeward. He was without coat or
vest and looked cool in his white outing shirt
and large straw hat. After some formalities
of introduction we reached the subject which I
had called to discuss, and he said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not customary to interview men of
my vocation concerning success.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any one who has made a lasting impression
on the minds of his contemporaries,” I began,
“and influenced men and women—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you refer to me?” he interrupted,
naïvely.</p>

<p class='c011'>I nodded and he laughed. “I have not endowed
a university nor made a fortune, nor
conquered an enemy in battle,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And those who have done such things have
not written ‘Locusts and Wild Honey’ and
‘Wake-Robin.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I recognize,” he said quietly, “that success
is not always where people think it is.
There are many ways of being successful; and
I do not approve of the mistake which causes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>many to consider that a great fortune acquired
means a great success achieved. On the contrary,
our greatest men need very little money
to accomplish the greatest work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought that anyone leading a life so
wholly at variance with the ordinary ideas and
customs would see success in life from a different
point of view,” I observed. “Money
is really no object with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The subject of wealth never disturbs me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You lead a very simple life here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such as you see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sight would impress anyone. So far is
this disciple of nature away from the ordinary
mode of the world, that his little cabin, set in
the cup-shaped top of a hill, is practically bare of
luxuries and the so-called comforts of life. His
surroundings are of the rudest, the very rocks
and bushes encroaching upon his back door.
All about, the crest of the hill encircles him,
and shuts out the world. Only the birds of the
air venture to invade his retreat from the various
sides of the mountain; and there is only
one approach by a straggling, narrow path. In
his house are no decorations but such as can be
hung upon the exposed wood. The fireplace is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of brick, and quite wide; the floor, rough
boards scrubbed white; the ceiling, a rough array
of exposed rafters; and his bed rudely constructed.
Very few and very simple chairs, a
plain table and some shelves for books make the
wealth of the retreat and serve for his ordinary
use.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c019'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f9'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This hut on the hill-top is situated in an old lake bed,
some three hundred yards wide, half filled with peat and
decomposed matter, swampy and overgrown. This area
was devoted by Mr. Burroughs to the raising of celery
for the market, when he set out to earn a living upon
the land.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Many people,” I said, “think that your
method of living is an ideal example of the way
people ought to live.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is nothing remarkable in that. A
great many people are very weary of the way
they think themselves compelled to live. They
are mistaken in believing that the disagreeable
things they find themselves doing, are the
things they ought to do. A great many take
their ideas of a proper aim in life from what
other people say and do. Consequently, they
are unhappy, and an independent existence such
as mine strikes them as ideal. As a matter of
fact, it is very natural.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you say that to work so as to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>able to live like this should be the aim of a
young man?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By no means. On the contrary, his aim
should be to live in such a way as will give his
mind the greatest freedom and peace. This
can be very often obtained by wanting less of
material things and more of intellectual ones.
A man who achieved such an aim would be as
well off as the most distinguished man in any
field. Money-getting is half a mania, and some
other ‘getting’ propensities are manias also.
The man who gets content comes nearest to being
reasonable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like,” I said, “to illustrate your
point of view from the details of your own
life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Students of nature do not, as a rule, have
eventful lives. I was born at Roxbury, New
York, in 1837. That was a time when conditions
were rather primitive. My father was a
farmer, and I was raised among the woods and
fields. I came from an uncultivated, unreading
class of society, and grew up among surroundings
the least calculated to awaken the
literary faculty. I have no doubt that daily
contact with the woods and fields awakened my
interest in the wonders of nature, and gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>me a bent toward investigation in that direction.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c019'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f10'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Blessed is he whose youth was passed upon a farm,”
writes Mr. Burroughs; “and if it was a dairy farm his
memories will be all the more fragrant. The driving of
the cows to and from the pasture every day and every
season for years,—how much of summer and of nature
he got into him on these journeys! What rambles and
excursions did this errand furnish the excuse for! The
birds and birds’ nests, the berries, the squirrels, the
woodchucks, the beech woods into which the cows loved
so to wander and browse, the fragrant wintergreens,
and a hundred nameless adventures, all strung upon that
brief journey of half a mile to and from the remote pasture.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Did you begin early to make notes and
write upon nature?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not before I was sixteen or seventeen.
Earlier than that, the art of composition had
anything but charms for me. I remember that
while at school, at the age of fourteen, I was
required, like other students, to write ‘compositions’
at stated times, but I usually evaded the
duty one way or another. On one occasion, I
copied something from a comic almanac, and
unblushingly handed it in as my own. But the
teacher detected the fraud, and ordered me to
produce a twelve-line composition before I left
school. I remember I racked my brain in vain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>and the short winter day was almost closing
when Jay Gould, who sat in the seat behind me,
wrote twelve lines of doggerel on his slate and
passed it slyly over to me. I had so little taste
for writing that I coolly copied that, and
handed it in as my own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were friendly with Gould then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, ‘chummy,’ they call it now. His
father’s farm was only a little way from ours,
and we were fast friends, going home together
every night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“His view of life must have been considerably
different from yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was. I always looked upon success as
being a matter of mind, not money; but Jay
wanted the material appearances. I remember
that once we had a wrestling match, and as we
were about even in strength, we agreed to abide
by certain rules,—taking what we called
‘holts’ in the beginning and not breaking them
until one or the other was thrown. I kept to
this in the struggle, but when Jay realized that
he was in danger of losing the contest, he broke
the ‘holt’ and threw me. When I remarked
that he had broken his agreement, he only
laughed and said, ‘I threw you, didn’t I?’ And
to every objection I made, he made the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>answer. The fact of having won was pleasing
to him. It satisfied him, although it wouldn’t
have contented me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you ever talk over success in life with
him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, quite often. He was bent on making
money, and did considerable trading among
us schoolboys,—sold me some of his books. I
felt then that my view of life was more satisfactory
to me than his would have been. I
wanted to obtain a competence, and then devote
myself to high thinking instead of to money-making.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c019'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f11'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An old schoolmate in the little red schoolhouse has
said, that “John and Jay were not like the other boys.
They learned their lessons easier; and at recess they
looked on the games, but did not join in them. John
always knew where to find the largest trout; he could
show you birds’ nests, and name all the flowers. He
was fond of reading, and would walk five miles to borrow
a book. Roxbury is proud of John Burroughs.
We celebrated ‘Burroughs Day’ instead of Arbor Day
here last spring, in the high school, in honor of him.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“How did you plan to attain this end?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By study. I began in my sixteenth or
seventeenth year to try to express myself on
paper, and when, after I had left the country
school, I attended the seminary at Ashland and
at Cooperstown, I often received the highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>marks in composition, though only standing
about the average in general scholarship. My
taste ran to essays, and I picked up the great
works in that field at a bookstore, from time to
time, and filled my mind with the essay idea.
I bought the whole of Dr. Johnson’s works at
a second-hand bookstore in New York, because,
on looking into them I found his essays appeared
to be solid literature, which I thought
was just the thing. Almost my first literary
attempts were moral reflections, somewhat in
the Johnsonian style.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were supporting yourself during these
years?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I taught six months and ‘boarded round’
before I went to the seminary. That put fifty
dollars into my pocket, and the fifty paid my
way at the seminary.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c019'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Working on the farm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>studying and teaching filled up the years until
1863, when I went to Washington and found
employment in the Treasury Department.”</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f12'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was when he was attending the academy, that
young Burroughs first saw that wonderful being—a
living author:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“I distinctly remember with what emotion I gazed
upon him,” he said, “and followed him about in the
twilight, keeping on the other side of the street. He
was of little account,—a man who had failed as a lawyer,
and then had written a history of Poland, which I have
never heard of since that time; but to me he was the
embodiment of the august spirit of authorship, and I
looked upon him with more reverence and enthusiasm
than I had ever before looked upon any man with. I
cannot divine why I should have stood in such worshipful
fear and awe of this obscure individual, but I suppose
it was the instinctive tribute of a timid and imaginative
youth to a power he was just beginning to see,—or
to feel,—the power of letters.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“You were connected with the Treasury
then?”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c019'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f13'>
<p class='c018'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“My first book, ‘Wake-Robin,’ was written while I
was a government clerk in Washington,” says Mr. Burroughs.
“It enabled me to live over again the days I
had passed with the birds, and in the scenes of my
youth. I wrote the book while sitting at a desk in front
of an iron wall. I was the keeper of a vault in which
many million of bank-notes were stored. During my
long periods of leisure, I took refuge in my pen. How
my mind reacted from the iron wall in front of me, and
sought solace in memories of the birds and of summer
fields and woods.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes; for nearly nine years. I left the
department in 1872, to become receiver of a
bank, and subsequently for several years I performed
the work of a bank examiner. I considered
it only as an opportunity to earn and save
up a little money on which I could retire. I
managed to do that, and came back to this region,
where I bought a fruit farm. I worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>that into paying condition, and then gave all
my time to the pursuit of the studies I like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had you abandoned your interest in nature
during your Washington life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. I gave as much time to the study of
nature and literature as I had to spare. When
I was twenty-three I wrote an essay on ‘Expression,’
and sent it to the ‘<i>Atlantic</i>.’ It was
so Emersonian in style, owing to my enthusiasm
for Emerson at that time, that the editor
thought some one was trying to palm off on
him an early essay of Emerson’s which he had
not seen. He found that Emerson had not
published any such paper, however, and printed
it, though it had not much merit. I wrote off
and on for the magazines.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The editor in question was James Russell
Lowell, who, instead of considering it without
merit, often expressed afterwards the delight
with which he read this contribution from an
unknown hand, and the swift impression of the
author’s future distinction which came to him
with that reading.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your successful work, then, has been in
what direction?” I said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In studying nature. It has all come by living
close to the plants and animals of the woods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>and fields, and coming to understand them.
There I have been successful. Men who, like
myself, are deficient in self-assertion, or whose
personalities are flexible and yielding, make a
poor show in business, but in certain other
fields these defects become advantages. Certainly
it is so in my case. I can succeed with
bird or beast, for I have cultivated my ability
in that direction. I can look in the eye of an
ugly dog or cow and win, but with an ugly man
I have less success.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I consider the desire which most individuals
have for the luxuries which money can
buy, an error of mind” he added. “Those
things do not mean anything except a lack of
higher tastes. Such wants are not necessary
wants, nor honorable wants. If you cannot get
wealth with a noble purpose, it is better to
abandon it and get something else. Peace of
mind is one of the best things to seek, and finer
tastes and feelings. The man who gets these,
and maintains himself comfortably, is much
more admirable and successful than the man
who gets money and neglects these. The realm
of power has no fascination for me. I would
rather have my seclusion and peace of mind.
This log hut, with its bare floors, is sufficient.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>I am set down among the beauties of nature,
and in no danger of losing the riches that are
scattered all about. No one will take my walks
or my brook away from me. The flowers, birds
and animals are plentifully provided. I have
enough to eat and wear, and time to see how
beautiful the world is, and to enjoy it. The entire
world is after your money, or the things
you have bought with your money. It is trying
to keep them that makes them seem so precious.
I live to broaden and enjoy my own life,
believing that in so doing I do what is best for
everyone. If I ran after birds only to write
about them, I should never have written anything
that anyone else would have cared to
read. I must write from sympathy and love,—that
is, from enjoyment,—or not at all. I come
gradually to have a feeling that I want to write
upon a given theme. Whenever the subject
recurs to me, it awakens a warm, personal response.
My confidence that I ought to write
comes from the feeling or attraction which
some subjects exercise over me. The work is
pleasure, and the result gives pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your work as a naturalist is what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Climbing trees to study birds, lying by the
waterside to watch the fishes, sitting still in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>the grass for hours to study the insects, and
tramping here and there, always to observe and
study whatever is common to the woods and
fields.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Men think you have done a great work,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have done a pleasant work,” he said,
modestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the achievements of your schoolmate
Gould do not appeal to you as having anything
in them worth aiming for?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not for me. I think my life is better for
having escaped such vast and difficult
interests.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The gentle, light-hearted naturalist and recluse
came down the long hillside with me, “to
put me right” on the main road. I watched him
as he retraced his steps up the steep, dark path,
lantern in hand. His sixty years sat lightly upon
him, and as he ascended I heard him singing.
Long after the light melody had died away, I
saw the serene little light bobbing up and down
in his hand, disappearing and reappearing, as
the lone philosopher repaired to his hut and his
couch of content.</p>

<p class='c013'>Vreeland’s Romantic Story: How He Came to Transport a Million Passengers a Day</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>A&nbsp;SHORT time ago, New York learned
with interest and some astonishment,
that the head of its greatest transportation
system, Herbert H. Vreeland, had received
from several of his associates as individuals,
a “valentine” present of $100,000, in
recognition of his superb management of their
properties. Many New Yorkers then learned,
for the first time, what railroad experts
throughout the country had long known, that
the transportation of a million people a day in
New York’s busy streets, without serious friction
or public annoyance, is not a matter of
chance, but is the result of perhaps the most
perfect traffic organization ever created, at the
head of which is a man, quiet, forceful, able,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>with the ability of a great general—a master
and at the same time, a friend of men,—himself
one for whom in the judgment of his associates
almost any higher railroad career is possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirty years ago Mr. Vreeland, then a lad
thirteen years old, was, to use his own humorous,
reminiscent phrase, “h’isting ice” on the
Hudson River, one of a gang of eighteen or
twenty men and boys filling the ice carts for
retail city delivery. A picture just brought to
light, shows him among the force lined up to be
photographed, as a tall, loosely built, hatchet-faced
lad in working garb, with a fragment of
a smile on his face, as if he could appreciate
the contrast of the boy of that day with the
man of the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>How do these things happen? What was
the divine spark in this boy’s brain and heart
that should lift him out of the crowd of the
commonplace to the position of responsibility
and influence in the world which he now occupies?
If my readers could have been present
at the interview kindly granted by Mr. Vreeland
to the writer, and could have heard him
recalling his early life and its many struggles
and disappointments with a smile that was
often near a tear, they would have gone away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>feeling that nothing is impossible to him who
dares, and, above all else, who <i>works</i>, and they
would have derived inspiration far greater than
can possibly be given in these written words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I first entered the railroad business in
1875,” said Mr. Vreeland, “shoveling gravel
on one of the Long Island Railroad Company’s
night construction trains. Though this position
was humble enough, it was a great thing
to me then to feel myself a railroad man, with
all that that term implied; and when, after a
few months’ trial, I was given the job of inspecting
ties and roadbed at a dollar a day, I
felt that I was well on the road to the presidency.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One day the superintendent asked my boss
if he could give him a reliable man to replace
a switchman who had just made a blunder leading
to a collision, and had been discharged.
The reply was, ‘Well, I’ve got a man named
Vreeland here, who will do exactly what you
tell him to.’ They called me up, and, after a
few short, sharp questions from the train-master,
I went down to the dreary and desolate
marsh near Bushwick, Long Island, and took
charge of a switch. For a few days I had to
camp out near that switch, in any way that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>might happen, but finally the officers made up
their minds that they could afford me the luxury
of a two-by-four flag-house with a stove in
it, and I settled down for more railroading.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Bushwick station was not far away,
and one of the company’s division headquarters
was there. I soon made the acquaintance of
all the officials around that station, and got into
their good graces by offering to help them out
in their clerical work at any and all times when
I was off duty. It was a godsend to them,
and exactly what I wanted, for I had determined
to get into the inside of the railroad
business from bottom to top. Many’s the time
I have worked till eleven or twelve o’clock at
night in that little station, figuring out train receipts
and expenses, engine cost and duty, and
freight and passenger statistics of all kinds;
and, as a result of this work, I quickly acquired
a grasp of railroad details in all stages, which
few managers possess, for, in one way and another,
I got into and through every branch of
the business.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My Bushwick switch was a temporary one,
put in for construction purposes only, and,
after some months’ use, was discontinued, and
I was discharged. This did not suit me at all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>and I went to one of the officials of the road
and told him that I wanted to remain with the
Long Island Railroad Company in any capacity
whatsoever, and would be obliged to him if
he would give me a job. He said, at first, that
he hadn’t a thing for me to do, but finally
added, as if he was ashamed to suggest it, that,
if I had a mind to go down on another division
and sweep out and dust cars, I might do it. I
instantly accepted, and thereby learned the details
of another important railroad department.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pretty soon they made me brakeman on an
early morning train to Hempstead, and then I
found that I was worth to the world, after two
years of railroad training, just forty dollars a
month, <i>plus</i> a perquisite or two obtained from
running a card-table department in the smoking-cars.
I remembered that I paid eighteen
dollars of my munificent salary for board and
lodging, sent twenty dollars home for the support
of my mother and sister, and had two dollars
a month and the aforesaid perquisites left
for ‘luxuries.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was about this time, thus early in my
career, that I first came to be known as ‘President
Vreeland.’ An old codger upon the railroad,
in talking to me one day, said, in a bantering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>way: ‘Well, I suppose you think your
fortune is made, now you have become a brakeman,
but let me tell you what will happen.
You will be a brakeman about four or five
years, and then they will make you a conductor,
at about one hundred dollars a month, and
there you’ll stick all your life, if you don’t get
discharged.’ I responded, rather angrily, ‘Do
you suppose I am going to be satisfied with remaining
a conductor? I mean to be president
of a railroad.’ ‘Ho, ho, ho!’ laughed the
man. He told the story around, and many a
time thereafter the boys slyly placed the word
‘President’ before my name on official instructions
and packages sent to me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A conductor on one of the regular trains
quarreled one morning with the superintendent
and was discharged. I was sent for and told
to take out that train. This was jumping me
over the heads of many of the older brakemen,
and, as a consequence, all the brakemen on that
train quit. Others were secured, however, and
I ran the train regularly for a good many
months.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then came an accident one day, for which
the engineer and I were jointly responsible.
We admitted our responsibility, and were discharged.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>I went again to the superintendent,
however, and, upon a strong plea to be retained
in the service, he sent me back to the ranks
among the brakemen. I had no complaint to
make, but accepted the consequence of my
mistake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Soon after this, the control of the road
passed into other hands. Many were discharged,
and I was daily expecting my own
‘blue envelope.’ One day, I was detailed to
act as brakeman on a special which was to convey
the president and directors of the road,
with invited guests, on a trip over the lines.
By that time I had learned the Long Island
Railroad in all its branches pretty well; and,
in the course of the trip, was called upon to
answer a great many questions. The next day
I received word that the superintendent wanted
to see me. My heart sank within me, for summonses
of this kind were ominous in those
days, but I duly presented myself at the office
and was asked, ‘Are you the good-looking
brakeman who was on the special yesterday
who shows his teeth when he smiles?’ I modestly
replied that I was certainly on the special
yesterday, and I may possibly have partly confirmed
the rest of the identification by a smile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>for the superintendent, without further questioning,
said: ‘The president wants to see you,
up stairs.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I went up, and in due time was shown into
the presence of the great man, who eyed me
closely for a minute or two, and then asked me
abruptly what I was doing. I told him I was
braking Number Seventeen. He said: ‘Take
this letter to your superintendent. It contains
a request that he relieve you from duty, and
put somebody else in your place. After he has
done so, come back here.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“All this I did, and, on my return to the
president, he said, ‘Take this letter at once to
Admiral Peyron, of the French fleet (then lying
in the harbor on a visit of courtesy to this
country), and this to General Hancock, on
Governor’s Island. They contain invitations
to each to dine with me to-morrow night at
my home in Garden City with their staffs. Get
their answers, and, if they say yes, return at
once to New York, charter a steamer, call for
them to-morrow afternoon, land them at Long
Island City, arrange for a special train from
Long Island City to Garden City, take them
there, and return them after the banquet. I
leave everything in your hands. Good day.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>“I suppose this might be considered a rather
large job for a common brakeman, but I managed
to get through with it without disgracing
myself, and apparently to the satisfaction of all
concerned. For some time thereafter, I was
the president’s special emissary on similar matters
connected with the general conduct of the
business, and while I did not, perhaps, learn so
very much about railroading proper, I was put
in positions where I learned to take responsibility
and came to have confidence in myself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The control of the Long Island Railroad
again changed hands, and I was again ‘let out,’
this time for good, so far as that particular
road was concerned,—except that, within the
last two or three years, I have renewed my acquaintance
with it through being commissioned
by a banking syndicate in New York City to
make an expert examination of its plant and
equipment as a preliminary to reorganization.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This was in 1881, or about that time, and
I soon secured a position as conductor on the
New York and Northern Railroad, a little line
running from One Hundred and Fifty-fifth
Street, New York City, to Yonkers. Not to
go into tedious detail regarding my experience
there, I may say in brief that in course of time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>I practically ‘ran the road.’ After some years,
it changed hands (a thing which railways, particularly
small ones, often do, and always to the
great discomposure of the employees), and the
new owners, including William C. Whitney,
Daniel S. Lamont, Captain R. Somers Hayes
and others, went over the road one day on a
special train to visit the property. As I have
said, I was then practically running the road,
owing to the fact that the man who held the
position of general manager was not a railroad
man and relied upon me to handle all details,
but my actual position was only that of train-master.
I accompanied the party, and knowing
the road thoroughly, not only physically
but also statistically, was able to answer all the
questions which they raised. This was the
first time I had met Mr. Whitney, and I judge
that I made a somewhat favorable impression
upon him, for not long after I was created general
manager of the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A few months later, I received this telegram:—</p>

<p class='c023'>‘<span class='sc'>H. H. Vreeland.</span></p>
<p class='c024'>‘Meet me at Broadway and Seventh Avenue office at
two o’clock to-day.</p>
<div class='c025'><span class='sc'>William C. Whitney.</span>’</div>

<p class='c016'>“I had to take a special engine to do this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>but arrived at two o’clock at the office of the
Houston Street, West Street and Pavonia
Ferry Railroad Company, which I then knew,
in an indistinct sort of way, owned a small
horse railway in the heart of New York. After
finding that Mr. Whitney was out at lunch, I
kicked my heels for a few minutes outside the
gate, and then inquired of a man who was
seated inside in an exceedingly comfortable
chair, when Mr. Whitney and his party were
expected, saying, also, that my name was Vreeland,
and I had an appointment at two. He
replied: ‘Oh, are you Mr. Vreeland? Well,
here is a letter for you. Mr. Whitney expected
to be here at two o’clock, but is a little late.’ I
took my letter and sat down again outside,
thinking that it might possibly contain an appointment
for another hour. It was, however,
an appointment of quite a different character.
It read as follows:—</p>

<p class='c023'>‘<span class='sc'>Mr. H. H. Vreeland.</span></p>
<p class='c024'>‘<span class='sc'>Dear Sir:</span>—At a meeting of the stockholders of the
Houston Street, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad
Company, held this day, you were unanimously
elected a director of the company.</p>

<p class='c024'>‘At a subsequent meeting of the directors, you were
unanimously elected president and general manager, your
duties to commence immediately.</p>
<p class='c026'>‘Yours truly,</p>
<p class='c027'><span class='sc'>C. E. Warren</span>, Secretary.’</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>“By the time I had recovered from my surprise
at learning that I was no longer a steam-railroad,
but a street-railroad man, Mr. Whitney
and other directors came in, and, after
spending about five minutes in introductions,
they took up their hats and left, saying, simply,
‘Well, Vreeland, you are president; now run
the road.’ I then set out to learn what kind
of a toy railway it was that had come into my
charge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Mr. Vreeland’s narrative stops, for the
rest of the history is well known to the people
of New York, and to experts in street railroading
throughout the country. The “Whitney
syndicate,” so called, was then in possession of
a few only out of some twenty or more street
railway properties in New York City, the
Broadway line, however, being one of these,
and by far the most valuable. With the immense
financial resources of Messrs. Whitney,
Widener, Elkins, and their associates, nearly
all the other properties were added to the original
ones owned by the syndicate, and with the
magnificent organizing and executive ability of
Mr. Vreeland, there has been built up in New
York a street railway system which, while including
less than two hundred and fifty miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>of track, is actually carrying more than one-half
as many passengers each year as are being
carried by all the steam railroads of the United
States together.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Vreeland’s first work on coming to New
York was, naturally, to familiarize himself
with the transportation conditions in New
York City, and to learn how to handle the peculiarly
complex problems involved in street
railroading. He first had to gain, also, the
confidence of his men, but this is never hard
for anyone who is sincerely solicitous for their
welfare, and in such sympathy with their work
and hardships as a man like himself must have
been, with his own past history in mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>With his hand firmly on the tiller, and with
his scheme of organization perfected, he was
soon able to take up the larger questions of administration.
To Mr. Vreeland is due the
credit of initiating and rapidly extending a general
free transfer system in New York, by
which the public is able to ride from almost
any part of the largest city in the country to
any other part, for a single five-cent fare,
whereas, before the consolidation, two, three,
and sometimes four fares would have to be
paid for the same ride.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>It was upon Mr. Vreeland’s recommendation,
also, backed by that of F. S. Pearson, the
well-known consulting engineer of the Whitney
syndicate, that the latter determined to
adopt the underground conduit electric system
in the reconstruction of the lines. At that time
this decision involved the greatest financial and
technical courage, since there was but one other
road of this kind in existence, and that a small
tramway in an Austrian city, while previous
American experience with this system had been
uniformly unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not only in street railroading proper, but
also in steam railroading, automobile work and
the electric lighting field, Mr. Vreeland possesses
the absolute confidence of his associates,
who rely implicitly upon his judgment, intelligence
and business acumen. The recent gift,
already referred to, is one only of several which
he has received from men who feel that they
have made millions through his ability. Although
he is not to-day a wealthy man, as men
are counted wealthy in New York City, he is
certainly well along on the road to millionaire-dom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Best of all, however, and what has probably
satisfied him most in his life, has been the host
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>of genuine friendships which he has made, and
the strong hold which he has upon the workingman.
A strike of the employees of the
Metropolitan Street Railway Company is absolutely
impossible so long as he remains at the
head of the company’s affairs, for the men
know well that there will be in that position a
man who is always fair, and even generous
with them, bearing in mind ever his duty to
his stockholders; and they know, too, that no
injustice will be committed by any of the department
heads. Any one of his four or five
thousand employees can meet him personally
on a question of grievance, and is sure of being
treated as a reasonable fellow man. Time and
again have labor leaders sought to form an organization
of the Metropolitan employees, and
as often the men have said in reply, “Not while
Vreeland is here,—we know he will treat us
fairly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In a recent address Mr. Vreeland said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“No artificial condition can ever, in my
judgment, keep down a man who has health,
capacity and honesty. You can temporarily
interfere with him or make the road to the object
of his ambition more difficult, but you cannot
stop him. That tyranny is forever dead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>and since its death there has come a great enlightenment
to the possessors of power and
wealth. Instead of preventing a man from rising,
there is not a concern the wide world over
that is not to-day eagerly seeking for capable
people. The great hunger of the time is for
good men, strong men, men capable of assuming
responsibility; and there is sharp competition
for those who are available.”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>XXII</h2>
</div>
<p class='c013'>How James Whitcomb Riley Came to be Master of the Hoosier Dialect</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_675 c014'>IT is doubtful if there is in the literary world,
to-day, a personage whose boyhood and
young manhood can approach in romance
and unusual circumstances that of the
author of “The Old Swimmin’ Hole.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All tradition was against his accomplishing
anything in the world. How, indeed, said the
good folks of the little town of Greenfield, Indiana,
could anything be expected of a boy who
cared nothing for school, and deserted it at the
first opportunity, to take up a wandering life.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>THROWN ON HIS OWN RESOURCES</h3>

<p class='c016'>The boy’s father wanted the boy to follow in
his footsteps, in the legal profession, and he
held out alluring hopes of the possibility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>scaling even greater heights than any to which
he had yet attained. Better still,—from the
standpoint of the restless James,—he took the
youngster with him as he made his circuit from
court to court.</p>

<p class='c011'>These excursions, for they were indeed such
to the boy, sowed deep in his heart the seed of
a determination to become a nomad; and it
was not long until he started out as a strolling
sign-painter, determined upon the realization
of his ideals.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oftentimes business was worse than dull,
and, on one occasion, hunger drove him for recourse
to his wits, and lo, he blossomed forth
as a “blind sign-painter,” led from place to
place by a little boy, and showered with sympathy
and trade in such abundance that he
could hardly bear the thought of the relinquishment
of a pretense so ingenious and successful,
entered on at first as a joke.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then came another epoch. The young man
fell in with a patent-medicine man, with whom
he joined fortunes, and here the young Indianian,
who had been scribbling more or less
poetry, found a new use for his talent; for his
duties in the partnership were to beguile the
people with joke and song, while his co-worker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>plied the sales of his cure-all. There were many
times when, but for his fancy, the young poet
might have seen his audience dwindle rapidly
away. It was while thus engaged, that he had
the opportunities which enabled him to master
thoroughly the Hoosier dialect.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the glamor of the patent-medicine
career had faded somewhat, the nomadic Riley
joined a band of strolling Thespians, and, in
this brief portion of his life, after the wont of
players of his class, played many parts.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length, he began to give a little more attention
to his literary work; and, later, obtained
a place on an Indianapolis paper, where
he published his first poems, and they won their
author almost instant success.</p>
<h3 class='c015'>WHY HE LONGED TO BE A BAKER</h3>

<p class='c016'>When I drew Mr. Riley out to talk still further
of those interesting days, and the strange
experiences which came to him therein, the conversation
finally turned on the subject of his
youthful ambition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think my earliest remembered one,” he
said, “was an insatiate longing to become a
baker. I don’t know what prompted it, unless
it were the visions of the mountains of alluring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>‘goodies,’ which, as they are ranged in the windows
of the pastry shops, appear doubly tempting
to the youth whose mother not only counsels
moderation, but enforces it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Next, I imagined that I would like to become
a showman of some sort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, my shifting fancy conjured up visions
of how grand it would be to work as a
painter, and decorate houses and fences in
glowing colors.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Finally, as I grew a little older, there returned
my old longing to become an actor.
When, however, my dreams were realized, and
I became a member of a traveling theatrical
company, I found that the life was full of hardships,
with very little chance of rising in the
world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never had any literary ambition whatever,
so far as I can remember. I wrote, primarily,
simply because I desired to have something to
read, and could not find selections that exactly
suited me. Gradually I found a demand for
my little efforts springing up; and so my
brother, who could write legibly transcribed
them.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>PERSISTENCE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>At this point I asked Mr. Riley his idea of
the prime requisites for success in the field of
letters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The most essential factor,” he replied “is
persistence,—the determination never to allow
your energy or enthusiasm to be dampened by
the discouragement that must inevitably come.
I believe that he is richer for the battle with the
world, in any vocation, who has great determination
and little talent, rather than his seemingly
more fortunate brother with great talent,
perhaps, but little determination. As for the
field of literature, I cannot but express my conviction
that meteoric flights, such as have been
taken, of recent years, by some young writers
with whose names almost everybody is familiar,
cannot fail to be detrimental, unless the man to
whom success comes thus early and suddenly is
an exceptionally evenly-balanced and sensible
person.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Many persons have spoken to me about
Kipling’s work, and remarked how wonderful
a thing is the fact that such achievements could
have been possible for a man comparatively so
young. I say, not at all. What do we find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>when we investigate? Simply that Kipling began
working on a newspaper when he was only
thirteen years of age, and he has been toiling
ever since. So you see, even that case confirms
my theory that every man must be ‘tried
in the fire,’ as it were.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He may begin early or late—and in some
cases the fight is longer than in others—but of
one thing I feel sure, that there is no short-cut
to permanent, self-satisfying success in literature,
or anything else.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>TWENTY YEARS OF REJECTED MANUSCRIPTS</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Mr. Riley,” I asked, “would you mind
saying something about the obstacles over
which you climbed to success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am afraid it would not be a very pleasant
story,” he replied. “A friend came to me
once, completely heartbroken, saying that his
manuscripts were constantly returned, and that
he was the most miserable wretch alive. I
asked him how long he had been trying?
‘Three years,’ he said. ‘My dear man,’ I answered,
laughing, ‘go on, keep on trying till
you have spent as many years at it as I did.’
‘As many as you did!’ he exclaimed. ‘Yes,
as long as I did.’ ‘What, you struggled for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>years!’ ‘Yes, sir; through years, through
sleepless nights, through almost hopeless days.
For twenty years I tried to get into one magazine;
back came my manuscripts eternally. I
kept on. In the twentieth year, that magazine
accepted one of my articles.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was not a believer in the theory that one
man does a thing much easier than any other
man. Continuous, unflagging effort, persistence
and determination will win. Let not the
man be discouraged who has these.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What would you advise one to do with his
constantly rejected manuscript?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Put it away awhile; then remodel it.
Young writers make the mistake I made.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What mistake?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hurrying a manuscript off before it was
dry from my pen, as if the world were just
waiting for that article and must have it. Now
it can hardly be drawn from me with a pair of
tweezers. Yes, lay it aside awhile. Reread.
There is a rotten spot somewhere. Perhaps
it is full of hackneyed phrases, or lacks in
sparkle and originality. Search, examine, rewrite,
simplify. Make it lucid. <i>I am glad,
now, that my manuscripts did come back.</i> Presently
I would discover this defect, then that.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Perhaps three or four sleepless nights would
show my failure to be in an unsymmetrical arrangement
of the verses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See these books?” he said, rapping upon
the book case with the back of his hand.
“Classics! but of what do they tell? Of the
things of their own day. Let us write the
things of our day. Literary fields exhausted!
Nonsense. If we write well enough, ours will
be the classics of to-morrow. Our young
Americans have, right at hand, the richest material
any country ever offered. Let them be
brave and work in earnest.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>A COLLEGE EDUCATION</h3>

<p class='c016'>Answering other questions, the poet said:—“A
college education for the aspirant for literary
success is, of course, an advantage, provided
he does not let education foster a false
culture that will lead him away from the ideals
he ought to cling to.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is another thing that the young man
in any artistic pursuit must have a care for;
and that is, to be practical. This is a practical
world, and it is always ready to take advantage
of this sort of people: so that one must try to
cultivate a practical business sense as well as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>artistic sense. We have only a few men like
Rudyard Kipling and F. Hopkinson Smith, who
seem to combine these diverse elements of character
in just the right proportions; but I believe
that it is unfortunate for the happiness
and peace of mind of our authors, and artists,
and musicians, that we have not more of them.”</p>
<h3 class='c015'>RILEY’S POPULARITY</h3>

<p class='c016'>Riley’s poetry is popular because it goes right
to the feelings of the people. He could not
have written as he does, but for the schooling
of that wandering life, which gave him an insight
into the struggle for existence among the
great unnumbered multitude of his fellow-men.
He learned in his travels and journeys, in his
hard experience as a strolling sign-painter and
patent-medicine peddler the freemasonry of
poverty. His poems are natural; they are those
of a man who feels as he writes. As Thoreau
painted nature in the woods, and streams, and
lakes, so Riley depicts the incidents of everyday
life, and brightens each familiar lineament
with that touch that makes all the world akin.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Marden’s new volume of essays, “Stepping Stones,” has the attractive
qualities made familiar to a large audience of readers by his earlier books.
At the same time it is entirely new in contents and most helpful and entertaining
in character. It contains talks to young people of both sexes full of
practical value, happy sketches of great characters, salient suggestions on
deportment and conduct, and shrewd advice of all kinds touching everyday
living. The author’s wide knowledge of history and literature is used to
give the essays atmosphere and quality, and no success book of the series is
more engaging and wholesome than “Stepping Stones.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The author in this book has set down the story of successful men and
women told by themselves, either in a series of interviews or by semi-autobiographical
sketches. They make a most entertaining and inspiring
series of life stories, full of incentive to ambitious youth.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The Boston Transcript says</i>: “To the young man who is determined to
succeed in life, no matter in what direction his aim may lie, this volume will
be a direct source of inspiration. It shows that the people ‘who have got
there’ have invariably done so through pluck, perseverance, and principle,
and not through ‘pull’ or social position. It emphasizes the fact that success
depends wholly and entirely upon the person himself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Marden has made for himself a wide reputation by his earlier volumes,
“Architects of Fate” and “Pushing to the Front.” But “Winning Out,”
while constructed along somewhat the same lines, is his first book designed
especially for young readers. Its theme is “Character Building by Habit
Forming.”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The Louisville Courier-Journal says</i>: “Pleasant teaching Dr. Marden’s
anecdotes make. They are of men and things that have actually been
and happened. The moral is often an epigram, always apropos. Through
the pages of the small volume pass a procession of figures that have aspired,
struggled, and achieved. Such work is good for the world, good for the
youth in it, and for more experienced and serious middle age.”</p>

It gives a picture of life in a large boarding-school, where

how their unjust power was broken by the hero of the
tale, who forms a rival baseball nine and manages to defeat
his opponents, thus bringing a better state of things
in the school socially and as to sports. The story is full
of lively action, and deals with baseball and general
athletic interests in a large school in a manner which
shows that the author is thoroughly acquainted with
and sympathetic to his subject.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
